                    <p>Let's kick off the year with some inspiration, shall we?</p>
                    <p>Ok - Michael Marcus... ever heard of him?</p>
                    <p>He's one of the original Market Wizards featured in Jack Schwager's book, and for good reason.</p>
                    <p>Marcus started his trading journey with just <span class="emp">$30,000</span> and turned it into a ridiculous <span class="emp">$80 million</span> trading commodities.</p>
                    <p>Yes, <span class="emp">$80 million‚Ä¶.</span></p>
                    <p>However you slice it, that's an incredible return.</p>
                </main>
                <main>
                    <h3>COURAGE</h3>
                    <div class="img50">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Jan/courage.jpg" alt="courage.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Marcus sadly died in March of 2023, but left behind a ton of wisdom.</p>
                    <p>If you haven't already, I highly recommend (re)reading the first <span class="fsi">Market Wizards</span> book to get the full picture.</p>
                    <p>But two of his quotes have always stuck with me:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span class="fsi">‚ÄúThe best trades are the ones in which you have all three things going for you:</span> <span class="emp">fundamentals, technicals, and market tone.‚Äù</span></li>
                        <li><span class="fsi">"Being a successful trader also <span class="emp">takes courage:</span> the courage to try, the courage to fail, the courage to succeed, and the courage to keep going when the going gets tough."</span></li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Why These Matter</h4>
                    <p>The first quote is so underrated. Even on lower timeframes, if you can align yourself with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emp">Fundamentals</span> (higher timeframe trend)</li>
                        <li><span class="emp">Market tone</span> (sentiment and trend persistence)</li>
                        <li><span class="emp">Technicals</span> (trade timing and execution)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You significantly improve your odds of being right more often‚Ä¶ and securing a handsome RvR for your trouble.</p>
                    <p>The second quote? Well, it speaks for itself.</p>
                    <p>Trading is tough. Success requires the courage to step up, take risks, learn from failure, and keep going when things get hard.</p>
                    <p>A solid reminder for us all.</p>

                    <p>But hey, it's a natural time for reflection, ideas, and deep thought.</p>
                    <p>Next week, it'll be back to normal service. Technical, tactical, mindset... all the good stuff to help you crush your Q1 goals.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime‚Ä¶ do this for me please.</p>
                    <p>Take some time to <span class="emp">audit your trades from last year.</span></p>

                    <p>Spend some time reviewing the charts for each. Look at the backdrop, the setup, and the trade execution, anything that feels significant to you.</p>
                    <p>I'm confident you'll uncover something valuable:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>Remember, often it's a <span class="emp">small shift in strategy, mindset, or approach</span> that can lead to major changes in your P&L.</p>

                <p>The USD Index (DXY) gained 0.8% on the week, breaking above 109, with GBP the notable underperformer in G10 FX on the week. EURUSD traded into 1.0224 but saw an element of short covering on Friday, and while all the talk remains on the timing for the spot rate to hit parity, the risk of a further squeeze higher this week looks possible. That said, <span class="key">I am skewed to sell rallies in EURUSD and would look to see how price reacts into 1.0345 (18 Dec low), where a more outsized rally should see rallies capped into 1.0425, which is where I'd preferably reengage with shorts.</span></p>

                <h3>Key data to navigate for the week ahead</h3>
                <p>Reviewing the marquee data points that could move markets this week.</p>
                <p><span class="emp bld">US Nonfarm Payrolls</span>  (Friday 13:30 UK / Saturday 00:30 AEDT) - the median estimate is for 160k jobs to have been added in December, with the economist's estimates ranging from 200k to 120k. Subsequently, any jobs print above 200k would be considered a 'surprise', where both US 10-year yields and the USD would rise strongly. US equity would likely rally despite a rise in rates, as a strong economy should trump reduced Fed easing expectations. Conversely, a jobs outcome below 140k would work against risk and the USD. The unemployment rate is also key, and with the market eyeing an unchanged read at 4.2%, USD and equity bulls would want to see a U/E print at or below 4.2%. Conversely, a lift above 4.3% and certainly at 4.4% would likely lead to some selling of equity risk and the USD.</p>

                    <p>You see, we can all get lost in a list of tasks, resolutions, and goals. It's easy to get sidetracked or caught up in the chaos of life.</p>
                    <p>But here's the neat trick he used to combat that:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Each year, come up with <span class="emp">one word</span> or short phrase that you want to represent you for the year.</p>
                    <p>Think of words or phrases like:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>You can then use this word or phrase as a quick reminder to align your decisions with your bigger goals.</p>
                    
                    <h4>To Dig Deeper</h4>
                    <p>Let's say improving your health is your focus this year. You want to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quit some vices</li>
                        <li>Drop a few pounds of fat</li>
                        <li>Gain muscle</li>
                        <li>Clean up your diet</li>
                        <li>Run a marathon</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Instead of overthinking all those goals, you could simplify everything into one word: <span class="emp">‚ÄúHealthy.‚Äù</span></p>
                    <p>That single word triggers all those smaller goals in your mind, helping you make better decisions and, over time, create a new identity.</p>

                    <p>I'm a fan of VWAP. So are algos and so are institutions. (I like to keep good company‚Ä¶)</p>
                    <p>The traditional VWAP is an intraday tool, a line in the sand, a fair value point that takes into account both price and volume.</p>
                    <p>Roughly speaking.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Price above = strong</li>
                        <li>Price below = weak</li>
                        <li>Price oscillating around the VWAP = indecision</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But what about if we zoom out a bit?</p>
                    <p>Can we use the VWAP on a higher time frame to help make better trading decisions?</p>
                    <p>I think we can‚Ä¶ let's explore.</p>
                </main>
                <main>
                    <h3>ANCHORED VWAP</h3>
                    <div class="img80">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Jan/Anchored VWAP-QQQ.png" alt="Anchored VWAP-QQQ.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>On most platforms, we can 'anchor' the VWAP to a specific point, a reference point that makes sense to start the VWAP calculations from. For example:</p>
                    <p><span class="emp bld">QQQ (above):</span> Anchored to 1st December (the first trading day of the month, a key date for many institutions). Price bounced off the anchored VWAP mid-December before Powell got involved‚Ä¶</p>

                        <img src="./assets/images/Jan/Anchored VWAP-Tesla.png" alt="Anchored VWAP-Tesla.png">
                        <p><span class="emp bld">Tesla:</span> Anchored to the start of the month, the VWAP acted as support until it crumbled later in the year.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="img80">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Jan/Anchored VWAP-GBPJPY.png" alt="Anchored VWAP-GBPJPY.png">
                        <p><span class="emp bld">GBP/JPY:</span> Anchored to the most recent swing high, providing a useful perspective.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="img80">

                        <p><span class="emp bld">Gold:</span> Anchored to a recent swing low, offering a strong buy zone during its move upward.</p>
                        <p><span class="fsi">Tip on Gold:</span> I used the <span class="emp">futures contract</span> instead of the CFD for better volume precision. CFD volume is okay, but nowhere near as accurate as futures, especially on smaller timeframes.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="img80">
                        <p>Here's a comparison: <span class="emp">Futures on the left, CFD on the right.</span></p>

                    <h4>WHERE TO ANCHOR VWAP?</h4>
                    <p>Anchor the VWAP to a point you believe has meaning to the market participants.</p>
                    <p>Here are some ideas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Earnings releases</li>
                        <li>Economic data (CPI, NFP, rate decisions)</li>
                        <li>Major news events</li>
                        <li>Market open (day, week, month)</li>
                        <li>Breakout candles</li>
                        <li>Swing highs or lows</li>
                        <li>Key pivot levels</li>
                        <li>Gap start (up or down)</li>
                        <li>Trendline breakpoints</li>
                        <li>Psychological levels (e.g., $100, 4,000)</li>
                        <li>All-time highs or lows</li>
                        <li>High-volume candles</li>
                        <li>Previous VWAP rejection points</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You get the idea.</p>
                    <p>Like everything in trading, it's all about experimenting. Try anchoring VWAP to points that resonate with your style and see how it works over time.</p>
                    <p>Happy VWAPing!</p>
                    <p>PS: I hosted a webinar called VWAP Trading Strategies which is worth a watch if you're into VWAP.</p>

                <p>Ah sizing up‚Ä¶ something on the mind of most traders.</p>
                <p>‚ÄúHow do I get bigger and make more from my trades?‚Äù</p>
                <p>But before you take that leap, ask yourself this:</p>
                <p class="emp">‚ÄúWhy do I want to size up?‚Äù</p>
                <p>Now, this might sound like a stupid question. You're probably thinking, <span class="fsi">‚ÄúTo make more money, obviously, Mark. Duh‚Äù</span></p>
                <p>Sure‚Ä¶but if that's the objective, there are other things you could do first.</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>SIZING UP</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Jan/sizing up.jpg" alt="sizing up.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>As soon as you increase size, you increase risk. There's no getting around it. Double the size, double the risk.</p>
                <p>And here's where many traders stumble, they start trading differently, using tighter stops or second-guessing their setups because they're uncomfortable with the larger position.</p>
                <p>So, before you jump to sizing up, consider these steps first:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><h5>Reduce your losers.</h5></li>
                        <p>If you can eliminate unnecessary losing trades, you'll boost your bottom line without taking on more risk.</p>
                    <li><h5>Hold your winners longer.</h5></li>
                        <p>If your strategy allows for it, extend your holding time on strong trades. Why take on the risk of a new trade when the one you're already in is working perfectly well?</p>
                </ol>
                <p class="emp">Exhaust these options first.</p>
                <p><span class="key">Squeeze every drop of profit from your winners</span> (within reason, we live in the real world here, it will never be perfect) <span class="key">and cut the dumb mistakes</span>. That alone is a significant boost to your P&L.</p>

                <h4>READY TO SIZE UP?</h4>
                <p>Let's assume you've optimised your trading, now what?</p>
                <p>Before you size up, make sure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><h5>Your discipline is bulletproof.</h5></li>
                        <p>Any cracks in your discipline will be magnified by larger size.</p>
                    <li><h5>You're consistent.</h5></li>
                        <p>Erratic returns and sizing up don't mix. Murphy's Law almost guarantees you'll size up right before a drawdown!</p>
                    <li><h5>You've handled drawdowns before.</h5></li>
                        <p>Have you proven you can stick to your process through a rough patch? If not, hold off.</p>
                </ul>
                <p class="emp">Be brutally honest:</p>
                <p>Are you sizing up because you're frustrated with slow progress, or is it a calculated decision to scale up a system that's been working consistently over time?</p>
                <p>When the time is right, you'll know‚Ä¶ you'll feel like you've earned the right to trade bigger. At that point, you can create a solid plan of action to increase size with confidence.</p>

                    <h3>A playbook for US nonfarm payrolls - Do all road lead to US equity weakness?</h3>
                    <p>Making a call on how US Treasuries and the USD react is fairly straightforward - if the U/E rate remains unchanged at 4.2%, and we see the number of payrolls come in above 200k+ then we will likely see Treasury yields rise and the USD finding good buyers. However, given we saw US equity sold in reaction to this week's hotter ISM Services and JOLTS print, the possible reaction in US equity to a better NFP print is now less clear - in theory, a solid NFP outcome should lift stocks, but with concerns of rising term premium, a higher discount rate and an early rise in inflation expectations, we could feasibly see a re-run of the ISM services move.</p>
                    <p>That being good data resulting in sellers of equity risk. Clearly, <span class="key">the US Treasury market holds the answers.</span></p>
                    <p>Conversely, a scenario where we see a weaker-than-expected NFP print (say below 130k), with a rise in the U/E rate would typically result in Treasury yields, the USD and equity all moving lower. I suspect this will also be the case this time around, and equity will unlikely rally just because Treasury yields are falling.</p>
                    <p>So, does this mean all roads from the NFP print lead to sellers in US equity? It seems that most paths do take us towards that outcome, and we'd need to see an outcome that is almost perfectly aligned to consensus expectations - not too hot, not too cold - and one that limits the movement in 10- and 30-year Treasuries. </p>

                    <h3>US CPI is the marquee data risk this week</h3>
                    <p>Recall the median estimate in the Fed's recent Statement of Economic Projection (SEP) was for core PCE inflation to come in at 2.8% in December - so should the elements from this week's US PPI and CPI reports feed into a higher implied core PCE tracking rate (due on 31 January), then the Fed's median 2.8% estimate would likely be seen as lowball and would justify the central pricing for just one rate cut this year - in fact, we may even start to hear increased talk of rate hike risk later this year - a point where the contrarian in me would feel Treasuries become a tactical buy and to position for increased rate cuts to start to be re-priced.</p>

                    <h3>What can derail the USD rally?</h3>
                    <div class="img80">
                        <h4>DXY (blue) vs US 10yr real Treasury</h4>

                    </div>
                    <p>The rise in US real rates and the repricing of the US interest rate swaps curve has been a clear tailwind for the USD, and the greenback is undoubtedly finding love from all circles within the FX ecosystem. On Friday we saw technical USD bullish breakouts vs the CHF, SEK, AUD, GBP, and NZD. That said, the downside in EURUSD still needs work to convince and requires a concerted push below the prior lows of 1.0224. USDCAD needs the buyers to step up for a push above the range highs of 1.4450, but I'd be looking for that to materialise should we see a hotter US core CPI print.</p>
                    <p>Many question what stops the USD from climbing further higher, however, the reality is that on current trends, we look around the G10 currency region and see a scarcity of attractive alternatives. The USD offers carry, relative growth, a hedge from looming tariff risk, and importantly it has momentum and trend working in its favour.</p>
                    <p><span class="emp">What derails the USD bull trend structurally would be improved economic data from other nations, and/or the upcoming US growth and inflation data starting to crack and deteriorate</span> - a seemingly low risk at this point, but it is feasible from late Q125. Tactically, the near-term risk for USD longs - other than a below consensus US core CPI and retail sales print - is positioning, with the USD now well-owned by real money accounts, and to a lesser extent leveraged players.</p>

                <p class="key">You are the <strong>General</strong>, and your <strong>capital</strong> is your army. <strong>Each trade</strong> is a <strong>battle</strong> you aim to win.</p>

                    <p>Today's US core PPI inflation data is expected to rise 0.3% m/m / 3.8% y/y (from 3.4%). This is an important data point, in that analysts will take various components from the PPI calculation and feed them into their models to gain a sense of the tracking rate for US core PCE inflation (due 31 Jan) - an outcome in PPI that therefore misses/beats expectations by a margin does have the potential to move US Treasuries around and by extension the USD, equity and crypto too.</p>
                    <p>With a number of big US banks reporting tomorrow, we've seen better buying interest in the big money centres, but most seem to be running a more neutral position into earnings. The XLF ETF has regained a footing above the 100-day MA, which is a small positive, while <span class="key">JP Morgan is testing the top of its recent tight consolidation range and is worth putting on the radar, as an upside break of $245.69 post earnings (JPM report in the pre-market session tomorrow) may be worth chasing</span>.</p>

                            <li>Am I trading my plan or my emotions?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h5>Practice the Art of Sitting on Hands</h5></li>
                        <p>On slow days, resist the urge to ‚Äúforce it.‚Äù Those small, unnecessary trades can quickly add up to big losses.</p>
                </ol>
                <h4>The Bigger Picture</h4>
                <p>Every great trader I know preaches patience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patience to wait for the setup.</li>
                    <li>Patience to let your winners run.</li>
                    <li>Patience to manage losses and preserve capital.</li>
                    <li>Patience to trade the process month after month after month</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="emp">The market rewards discipline over impulsiveness.</p>
                <p>Every. Single. Time.</p>
                <p>Remember, one moment of patience today can protect your account, and your mindset, for the long haul.</p>
                <p>So, next time you feel the urge to trade impulsively, pause.</p>
                <p>Take a breath. Remind yourself of the long game.</p>

                <p>In my early trading years (2001+), I dedicated all my time to reading the tape.</p>
                <p>I was glued to the order book, time and sales, and a 1-minute chart, learning to spot early algos and iceberg orders, then trading around them.</p>
                <p>Back then, algos were so primitive that if you identified one at work, you could assume there was more size behind it. You'd bid one tick above and use it as a wall of support.</p>
                <p>There were plenty of plays.</p>
                <p>But as the market evolved and algos became smarter, that game ended. Orders became harder to spot as they worked more discreetly, letting price drop, sweeping offers, and mixing it up to avoid detection.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to today, and the game has completely changed.</p>
                <p>Yet one thing remains constant: <span class="emp">price and how it moves.</span></p>

                <p>If you've read <span class="fsi">Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</span>, you'll know Jesse Livermore used to read the tape.</p>
                <p>Back in the 1930s, traders watched prices come through a ticker tape machine, gauging market strength or weakness based on price changes.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="emp">70,71,73,75,77,81,81,83,84 = Strong tape, urgent buying</span></li>
                    <li><span class="emp">70,71,72,71,72,71,71,70,71 = Mixed, no urgency</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>They focused on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="emp">Pace of the tape</span></li>
                    <li><span class="emp">Price changes</span></li>
                    <li><span class="emp">Price response to key levels</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These insights helped them anticipate where the market might go next.</p>

                <h4>TODAY'S TAPE</h4>
                <p>Sure, we aren't reading prices on thin strips of paper anymore, but the principles are the same.</p>
                <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How does price respond to a prior high or low?</li>
                    <li>What's the speed of price change?</li>
                    <li>How much volume and range occurred in that 5-minute window?</li>
                    <li>Is there urgency in the price action at the open?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="key">By observing how price reacts at <strong>key levels</strong> and <strong>critical moments</strong>, you can uncover <strong>who's in control</strong>, and use that insight to <strong>inform your trades</strong>.</p>
                <p>These days, I believe that's enough edge without needing Level 2 or the Order Book. <span class="fsi">(Though if watching the ladder works for you, keep going!)</span></p>
                <p>We've almost done a full circle. Watching price only, then watching price and market depth, now back to watching price whilst the robots battle it out on the book‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>The tape may have evolved, but price still tells a story.</p>

                <p>Here's a neat little discipline hack for you.</p>
                <p>This one came from trader Ruchir, listen to my conversation with him here:</p>
                <p>&#x1F3A7; <a href="https://www.tradersmastermind.com/from-9-to-5-to-all-in/" target="_blank">From 9-to-5 to All-In: Ruchir Patel's Leap to Full-Time Trading</a></p>
                <p>Now, Ruchir picked it up from somewhere else‚Ä¶ so whoever originally came up with it, credit where it's due.</p>
                <p>It's a simple, effective way to level up your discipline‚Ä¶</p>

                <h3>STREAKS</h3>
                <div class="img80">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Jan/Streaks.png" alt="Streaks.png">
                </div>
                <p>The idea is to gamify your trading discipline.</p>
                <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h5>Set Clear Rules</h5></li>
                            <p>Create a small set of rules that are straightforward, with clear yes/no answers. No ambiguity or subjective interpretations.</p>
                            <h6>Examples:</h6>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="emp">Good Rule:</span> Did I stick to my max 5 trades per day rule?</li>
                                    <li><span class="emp">Flakey Rule:</span> Did I trade well?</li>
                                </ul>
                        <li><h5>Track Daily</h5></li>
                            <p>Each day, check if you followed all your rules. If yes, you earn 1 streak mark.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Day 1 = 1</li>
                                    <li>Day 2 = 2</li>
                                    <li>Day 6 = 6</li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>But‚Ä¶ if you break a rule, your streak resets to zero.</p>
                            <p>You get the idea‚Ä¶</p>
                        <li><h5>Build Momentum</h5></li>
                            <p>As your streak grows, you'll be more motivated to stick to your rules, you won't want to break the streak.</p>
                            <p>Rinse and repeat until you are a disciplined wizard!</p>
                            <p>Oh and actually, the <span class="emp">Traders Mastermind Discipline Tracker</span> Google Sheet is perfect for this. With a bit of tweaking, you can set up a streak system and start building momentum.</p>

                <p>I can't help but think the Stoics would've been awesome traders.</p>
                <p>I can just see it now‚Ä¶</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Epictetus smashing the DOW.</li>
                        <li>Aurelius rinsing the DAX.</li>
                        <li>Seneca dominating Crude Oil.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Am I right?!</p>
                <p>But, sadly, times were a lot tougher back then‚Ä¶ which is probably why Stoicism was so necessary.</p>
                <p>Sh1t was rough.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to today, and many of the Stoics' principles and virtues still apply, especially to trading‚Ä¶</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>STOIC VIRTUES</h3>

                    <img src="./assets/images/Jan/Stoic virtues.jpg" alt="Stoic virtues.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>The Stoics believed in four key virtues:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h5>Wisdom</h5></li>
                            <p class="key">The ability to make <strong>sound judgments</strong>, <strong>think rationally</strong>, and act based on <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>understanding</strong>.</p>
                        <li><h5>Courage</h5></li>
                            <p>The strength to face challenges, endure adversity, and take action even when it's difficult.</p>
                        <li><h5>Justice</h5></li>
                            <p>Acting fairly, ethically, and with integrity, treating others with respect.</p>
                        <li><h5>Temperance</h5></li>
                            <p>Practicing self-control, moderation, and restraint, avoiding excess or overindulgence.</p>
                    </ol>
                <p>The parallels to trading are obvious, right?</p>
                <p>I believe a great trader embodies these virtues not just in the markets but in life.</p>
                <p>Improving bit by bit as a person often brings the added bonus of becoming a better trader‚Ä¶ and vice versa.</p>
                <p>Something to ponder‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>Welcome to the <span class="fsi">Valley of Despair</span>. (Sounds like a lovely holiday destination, doesn't it‚Ä¶)</p>
                <p>It's here that many traders start <strong>strategy-hopping</strong>:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>‚ÄúMaybe I'll have better luck with DAX instead of FX.‚Äù</li>

                <p class="emp">(Doom and gloom so far, I know. But stay with me.)</p>
                <p>If you can hold on, if you can resist the urge to quit or keep chasing shiny objects, eventually, you'll claw your way out.</p>
                <p>And that's when you'll reach the next stage: <span class="emp">Informed Optimism.</span></p>
                <p>At this stage you know what needs to be done, you can see light at the end of the tunnel and are pretty bullish on the future‚Ä¶ it just takes time.</p>
                <p>The next step? <span class="emp">Achievement.</span></p>
                <p>This is where the rubber finally meets the road.</p>
                <p>You start seeing the payoff from all those hours of work. The <strong>strategy tweaks</strong>, the <strong>mindset shifts</strong>, the <strong>discipline‚Ä¶</strong> it all begins to click.</p>

                <h4>SO, WHERE ARE YOU?</h4>

                <p>Every trader goes through these stages.</p>

                <p>If there's one way ChatGPT can really help, it's by maintaining a consistent trading process and keeping your discipline on point.</p>
                <p>The idea?</p>
                <p>Create your very own <span class="emp">Trading Accountability Buddy</span>.</p>
                <h4>Here's how it works:</h4>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>Tell ChatGPT:</li>
                        <li class="fsi">"I want you to act as my trading accountability buddy. Each morning, ask me these pre-market questions one by one and challenge my answers to ensure I've thought them through properly.‚Äù</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Then paste in your pre-market checklist, like this:</p>
                <h5>Market Conditions</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have you checked the overnight news and global markets?</li>
                        <li>What's the pre-market trend for the S&P 500, NASDAQ, or Dow?</li>
                        <li>Are there any major economic reports or events scheduled today?</li>
                    </ul>
                <h5>Watchlist</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have you updated your watchlist for the day?</li>
                        <li>Are there any stocks gapping up or down significantly in pre-market?</li>
                        <li>What are the key levels (support/resistance) for your top 3 tickers?</li>
                    </ul>
                <h5>Trading Plan</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What setups are you looking for today (trend continuation, reversals, etc.)?</li>
                        <li>What are your planned entries, stop-losses, and targets for each trade?</li>
                        <li class="key">Do you have alternative scenarios if the market doesn't behave as expected?</li>
                    </ul>
                <h5>Risk Management</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is your max risk per trade and for the day?</li>
                        <li>Have you double-checked your position sizing calculations?</li>
                        <li>Is there a plan to avoid overtrading if conditions aren't favourable?</li>
                    </ul>
                <h5>Mental Prep</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How are you feeling today? (Stressed, focused, tired?)</li>
                        <li class="key">Do you have a plan to stay <strong>disciplined</strong> and avoid <strong>impulsive trades</strong>?</li>
                        <li>Have you reviewed yesterday's trades to learn from them?</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Here's what happens:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>ChatGPT will ask you each question individually, waiting for your response.</li>
                        <li>It'll <span class="fsi">challenge</span> your answers to ensure you've considered them thoroughly.</li>
                        <li>Once done, it can summarise your answers and even highlight areas to improve.</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>For example, when asked about market conditions, ChatGPT might say:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>‚ÄúHave you checked global markets thoroughly? What about any major earnings or Fed speeches today?‚Äù</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="img80">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Jan/Market conditions.png" alt="Market conditions.png">
                    </div>
                <p>And then it moves to the next question.</p>
                <p>You get the idea‚Ä¶</p>
                <h4>BONUS TIP</h4>
                    <p>You can go even further by asking ChatGPT to fetch data for you, like economic calendars or earnings reports, to streamline your prep.</p>
                <h4>TRY IT OUT</h4>
                    <p>If you don't already have a ChatGPT account, grab one at OpenAI and start experimenting. I use the paid version which is $20pm or something, but they do have a free version.</p>
                <p>It's not a magic bullet, but I think it's an excellent tool to stay <strong>sharp</strong>, <strong>organised</strong>, and <strong>disciplined</strong>.</p>

                        <img src="./assets/images/Jan/The 5 day discipline challenge.jpg" alt="The 5 day discipline challenge.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>For the next five days, stick to one simple rule:</p>
                        <ul class="non">
                            <li class="emp">Start each trading day with a list of 3 things you'll do, no matter what.</li>
                            <li>That's it.</li>
                            <li>Not 2, not 5, not 20‚Ä¶ just 3.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><h5>Pick 3 high-impact actions every morning.</h5></li>
                                <h6>Examples:</h6>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Run through your pre-market checklist.</li>
                                        <li>Set clear entry, exit, and risk levels before each trade.</li>
                                        <li class="key">Take a 5-minute break after every trade to <strong>review</strong> your execution.</li>
                                    </ul>
                            <li><h5>Stick to them. No exceptions.</h5></li>
                                <p>If it's on your list, it gets done. No excuses. No ‚ÄúI'll do it later.‚Äù</p>
                            <li><h5>Review your results every evening.</h5></li>
                                <p>Did you follow through? Where did you slip up? What will you adjust tomorrow?</p>
                        </ol>
                    <h4>Why does this work?</h4>
                        <p>Because trading success isn't about big wins or complex strategies. <span class="key">It's about mastering small, repeatable habits that build discipline over time.</span></p>
                        <p>Build discipline, build confidence.</p>
                    <h4>So, here's your Day 1 task:</h4>
                        <ul class="non">
                            <li>Write down 3 non-negotiable actions you'll take today.</li>
                            <li>Keep them <strong>simple</strong>. Keep them <strong>specific</strong>. Then, <strong>execute</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Most traders won't even make it past Day 3. But if you commit to the full 5 days, you'll notice something:</p>
                    <p>You're <strong>calmer</strong>. More <strong>focused</strong>. More in <strong>control</strong>.</p>
                    <p>That's the power of discipline.</p>
                    <p>Give it a go‚Ä¶ you can do 5 days? Right?</p>

                <p>This <span class="emp">might</span> just spark a fresh idea for a discretionary scalping approach or even a testable rule-based system‚Ä¶</p>
                <p class="fsi">(And, as always, this isn't advice, do your own research. I'm just sharing something I found interesting. Cool? Cool.)</p>
                <p>So, here's the setup: Last week, while watching Trump's speech at Davos, I noticed the usual market chaos:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Order books thinned out.</li>
                        <li>Nasdaq spiked up and down as traders reacted.</li>
                        <li>And once he stopped talking, it was back to normal price behaviour.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="key">Why? Institutions and market makers pull liquidity to avoid getting caught off guard by anything unpredictable.</p>
                <p>That leaves the book thinner than usual, so when size hits the bid or offer, it creates exaggerated price spikes.</p>
                <p>And as a scalper, those whipsaws could be gold.</p>
                <p>Here's where a blend of two indicators comes in‚Ä¶</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>STOCHASTICS + ADR</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Jan/STOCHASTICS+ADR.jpg" alt="STOCHASTICS+ADR.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>Now, I'm not usually a fan of stochastics‚Ä¶ but ADR? I like it.</p>
                <p>Here's the concept:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emp">Stochastics</span> helps identify when price is at the upper or lower range of its recent movement.</li>
                        <li><span class="emp">ADR</span> (Average Daily Range) highlights abnormal spikes in price activity compared to the norm. (Especially when you compare two lookbacks.)</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Combine the two, and you've got a simple way to spot potential opportunities:</p>
                <h4>Example Strategy:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use a 10-second chart (yes, tiny timeframe, it's scalping).</li>
                            <h5>For a long trade:</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stochastics shows oversold.</li>
                                    <li>ADR(1) > ADR(20) (the current bar's range is larger than the average of the last 20 bars = price spike).</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h5>For a short trade:</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stochastics shows overbought.</li>
                                    <li>ADR(1) > ADR(20).</li>
                                </ul>
                        <p>Keep it simple with a stop and target of 1 ADR.</p>
                        <p>Here's what a chart looked like after modifying our premium Amber indicator to visualise this:</p>
                        <p>&#x1F4DC; <a href="https://www.tradersmastermind.com/trading-tools/" target="_blank">TM Scalper (Amber)</a></p>

                        </div>
                    </ol>
                <h4>FINAL THOUGHTS</h4>
                <p>So, the chart's quite interesting‚Ä¶ but let's be honest it's a small sample size (1 speech!) and there's lots of work to do to turn it into a robust risk-managed system.</p>
                <p>But, it could be a decent seed of an idea. (Many one for you scalpers and system designers‚Ä¶)</p>
                <p>If you take this idea further and turn it into something actionable, I'd love to hear how it plays out.</p>
                <p>For now, just sharing my experiments.</p>

                <p>A chance to <strong>reflect</strong>, <strong>reset</strong>, and <strong>recharge</strong> without all the noise in preparation to go again on Monday. <span class="fsi">(I don't know how you Crypto boys and girls can stay on point 24/7!)</span></p>

                <p>Focus on <span class="emp">direction</span>, not <span class="emp">speed</span>.</p>
                <p>I came across this post from Sahil Bloom on X recently, and while he probably wasn't talking about trading‚Ä¶ it's so relevant to us.</p>
                <p class="key">How often do you catch yourself rushing the process? Chasing that equity curve goal as fast as possible, without really considering the path you're on‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is this strategy truly aligned with where I want to go?</li>
                        <li>Is my discipline solid, or am I just getting lucky and hoping?</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="key">It's far better to slow down, audit where you're heading, and make any necessary course corrections.</p>
                <p class="key">Running at full speed in the wrong direction only gets you further from where you want to be.</p>
                <p>I also stumbled across this Japanese saying:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li class="emp">‚ÄúIf you get on the wrong train, get off at the nearest station. The longer it takes to get off, the more expensive the return trip will be.‚Äù</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>It's spot on for trading.</p>
                <p class="key">If something doesn't feel right, whether it's your <strong>strategy</strong>, <strong>mindset</strong>, or <strong>process</strong>, don't just ‚Äústick it out‚Äù for the sake of it.</p>
                <p>Make the adjustments now.</p>
                <p class="key">Use those resources - <strong>time</strong>, <strong>focus</strong>, and <strong>energy</strong> to steer toward the right destination for <span class="emp">you</span>.</p>

                    <p>European equity indices recorded a huge January, seeing arguably the best risk-adjusted returns across asset classes and there are signs that outperformance may kick back into gear. The <strong>GER40 (DAX)</strong> was recently my preferred index of choice on the long side, but I am seeing the <strong>EU Stoxx 50</strong> and <strong>SPA35</strong> as my current preferred long expressions here, with the price action and the technical set-up suggesting a probability that both could kick to new highs in the near-term.</p>
                    <p>Earnings continue to roll in from EU corporates and they have largely been well received - <strong>Infineon</strong> certainly kicked onto the radar with a result that has delivered the goods, with the share price closing +10.4% and threatening to break out to the best levels since July 2024. Perhaps some of the sentiment from Infineon's earnings have spilt over into the US semis and global high momentum plays, with Meta, Googl, IBM, and Amazon all breaking out to new highs. While not at ATHs, ARM, BABA and Atlassian all look strong, and I like these names further higher in the near term.</p>

                <p>Let's talk about Bill Ackman.</p>
                <p>Founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital, <span class="key">with a net worth of approximately <strong>$10 billion</strong>,</span> he's pretty much nailed the hedge fund game.</p>
                <p>But even the best aren't immune to mistakes‚Ä¶ and Ackman's infamous <strong>Herbalife</strong> short trade is proof of that.</p>
                <p>Let's break it down, learn from his mistakes, and most importantly recognise that even the best in the world get it wrong sometimes‚Ä¶ <span class="fsi">(so no need to beat yourself up over that missed fill.)</span></p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>THE HERBALIFE SHORT TRADE</h3>
                <div class="img80">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Feb/The Herbalife short trade.png" alt="The Herbalife short trade">
                </div>
                <p>In 2013, an analyst from Pershing Square pitched Ackman the idea of shorting Herbalife, a company selling dietary supplements, like shakes, bars, and the like through multi-level marketing (MLM).</p>
                <p class="fsi">For context, MLM involves individuals selling products while recruiting others to do the same, earning commissions from both their own sales and their recruits.</p>
                <p>Here's how it works: I buy a batch of shakes at wholesale, sell a few tubs to you, and then recruit you to do the same with your friends. You sell a few, sign up some of your pals, and they repeat the process with their own circles.</p>
                <p>The cycle keeps going, relying on a steady stream of new recruits to keep the money flowing.</p>
                <p>It's not illegal, but it can sometimes push boundaries, depending on how the structure is set up.</p>
                <p><span class="emp">Anyway, back to the trade‚Ä¶</span> Ackman alleged that Herbalife:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Made misleading claims.</li>
                        <li>Operated an unsustainable business model.</li>
                        <li>Preyed on vulnerable communities.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="key">So, he publicly announced a large short position, backed by research, hoping media attention would enhance his trade.</p>
                <p>And at first, it worked‚Ä¶ The stock dropped, and Ackman looked like a genius.</p>

                <h4>Enter Carl Icahn.</h4>
                <p>Years earlier, Ackman had made an enemy of Icahn, another billionaire fund manager with a reputation for aggressive tactics.</p>
                <p>Smelling an opportunity for revenge, Icahn built a massive <span class="fsi">long</span> position in Herbalife and publicly mocked Ackman's short.</p>
                <p>The beef escalated when the two faced off live on CNBC, trading insults and calling each other names like schoolboys on national television.</p>
                <p>Watch the clip on YouTube, it's surreal!:</p>
                <p>&#x1F4FA; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LRW1PVM3jk" target="_blank">Billionaire Brawl: Icahn vs. Ackman | CNBC</a></p>
                <p>In the end, Ackman's position dragged on for years, and he eventually had to cut the trade, walking away with <span class="key">over $1 billion in losses</span>.</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>ACKMAN'S MISTAKES</h3>
                <p>Ackman later reflected on what went wrong:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Naked Shorting</h5>
                            <p>He typically used Credit Default Swaps to limit his downside, but here he shorted the stock directly, exposing himself to unlimited losses. <span class="fsi">(was this his biggest mistake?)</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Emotional Involvement</h5>
                            <p>Once Icahn got involved, it became personal‚Ä¶ a battle of egos rather than a trade idea. <span class="fsi">(TBF Icahn played a blinder here, he knew how to turn the screw)</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Blinded by Bias</h5>
                            <p>Ackman became so emotionally invested that he couldn't see the trade clearly. He was convinced Herbalife should fail and refused to consider he might be wrong or that the trade was mistimed. Despite being proven right <span class="fsi">eventually</span>, poor timing and emotions turned this bad boy into a costly mistake.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <p>(Check out Ackman's full breakdown of the trade in this Lex Fridman interview. It's worth a watch.)</p>

            <main>
                <h3>LESSONS FOR US TRADERS</h3>
                <p>Even after losing a billion dollars, after clearing the decks Ackman bounced back, posting a <span class="key"><strong>58%</strong> return in 2019</span> and an astounding <span class="key"><strong>70%</strong> in 2020</span>. So, what can we learn from this?</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h5>The best make mistakes.</h5>
                            <p>Even seasoned pros aren't immune to breaking rules and making bad trades, accept it and move on.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Control your emotions.</h5>
                            <p class="key">When emotions rule, logic fails.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Stick to your golden rules.</h5>
                            <p>Ackman broke his own rule by shorting stock directly. If he hadn't, the trade might have ended differently.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Don't get married to a position.</h5>
                            <p class="key">When the thesis changes, so should you.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Clear the slate.</h5>
                            <p class="key">Sometimes, closing out everything and starting fresh is the best move.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Trust your process.</h5>
                            <p class="key">Your strategy exists for a reason‚Ä¶ don't abandon it.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <p>And while none of us will likely lose a billion dollars on a trade <span class="fsi">(yet‚Ä¶ I know there are some pretty ambitious traders reading this, give them a decade or so)</span>, <span class="key">the principles remain the same, no matter your account size.</span></p>
                <p class="key">Trade smart, stay disciplined, and remember: mistakes are part of the journey‚Ä¶ but only if you learn from them.</p>
                <p>PS: Yes, I know this is longer than usual, I just thought it was a cool story‚Ä¶ normal service resumes tomorrow :-)</p>

                    <p>We're not talking about an epic door stop of a novel here, but it has got some super valuable lessons.</p>
                    <p>Here's what stood out to me:</p>
                        <ul class="cust">
                            <li><span class="emp">Personal Legend</span> - The book talks about finding your calling. Many traders feel a deep pull toward the markets, but <strong>fear</strong>, <strong>doubt</strong>, and <strong>comfort zones</strong> hold them back. If this is <span class="fsi">your</span> calling, own it.</li>
                            <li><span class="emp">Omens & Intuition</span> - The main character, Santiago, learns to trust the signs around him. The same goes for trading‚Ä¶<strong>recognising patterns</strong>, <strong>trusting instincts</strong>, and understanding that when you <strong>align with the process</strong>, things tend to work in your favour.</li>
                            <li><span class="emp">Journey Over Destination</span> - We're all chasing a goal‚Ä¶ a <strong>yearly P&L target</strong>, a <strong>milestone account size</strong>, but the <span class="fsi">process</span> of getting there is where the real value lies. The <strong>discipline</strong>, the <strong>setbacks</strong>, the <strong>growth‚Ä¶</strong> that's where you truly <strong>level up</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>And the real gem‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Santiago faces <strong>setback</strong> after <strong>setback‚Ä¶</strong> but <strong>keeps going</strong>.</p>
                    <p class="key">Because the only way to fail is to stop.</p>
                    <p>And hey, if a shepherd can navigate the desert, read omens, and find treasure‚Ä¶ <span class="key">surely we can handle a few losing trades‚Ä¶</span></p>

                    <p>Gold traders know the dynamic seen in the copper market only too well, with fears of impending Trump tariffs on gold imports resulting in another 3.28m troy oz of physical gold delivered to Comex vaults in the US last week. The scene in the London markets is clearly precarious, with a significant scarcity of physical gold leading to a spike higher in short-term lending rates and even in the borrowing rates in the GLD ETF. We see that stress in the paper market, with electronic claims trading at a decent discount to spot gold or futures pricing, with counterparty risk clearly on the rise.</p>

                <p>Do you ever use a <span class="emp">trading simulator</span>?</p>
                <p>Not just a demo account, but actually <span class="emp">replaying market conditions‚Ä¶</span>like a movie, <strong>bar by bar</strong>, <span class="key">testing your price action skills</span> as if it were unfolding live?</p>
                <p>Why do I ask?</p>
                <p>Well, I was reading a 15-year-old blog post from Brett Steenbarger the other day</p>
                <p>&#x1F4DC;<a href="https://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2010/02/training-traders-role-of-simulation-in.html" target="_blank">Training Traders: The Role of Simulation in Supercharging Learning</a></p>
                <p>And it got me thinking‚Ä¶</p>
                <p class="emp">Should we all be using a simulator more?</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>MARKET REPLAY: AN UNDERRATED EDGE</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Feb/Market replay.jpg" alt="Market replay">
                </div>
                <p>A lot of traders I know use the <span class="key"><strong>replay function</strong> on <strong>TradingView</strong></span>.</p>
                <p>But I'd bet more <span class="emp">don't</span> than <span class="emp">do‚Ä¶</span> and I think that's a missed opportunity.</p>
                <p>Here's how a simulator can level up your game:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üîÑ <span class="emp">Replay your own trades:</span> Both the ones you nailed and the ones you butchered. Missing a trade by a few ticks stings‚Ä¶ but you can replay and see what you missed</li>
                    <li>‚è≥ <span class="emp">Replay <strong>key times</strong> of day:</span> Like every opening 15 minutes from the last month, compressed into a weekend. Mainlining opens on a Sunday morning, anyone?!</li>
                    <li>üìä <span class="emp">Replay specific conditions:</span> Trend days, range days, news-driven moves, whatever you want to master. If you were a total sadist you could replay the price action from Trump's tweets‚Ä¶</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The list is endless.</p>
                <p>So this weekend, maybe take a minute to think:</p>
                <p>How could <span class="emp">you</span> use <strong>simulation</strong> to <strong>refine</strong> your <strong>execution</strong> and <span class="key">price action read</span>?</p>
                <p>Because <span class="key">the best traders don't just learn from <strong>live markets‚Ä¶</strong> they <span class="emp">train</span> for them</span>.</p>

                <p>Do you keep trading, pressing your edge? Or do you lock in those gains before you give it all back?</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>LOCK OR NOT</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Feb/Lock or not.jpg" alt="Lock or not">
                </div>
                <p>There are two schools of thought here‚Ä¶</p>
                <h4>Option 1: Press Your Edge</h4>
                <p>If you're in tune with the market and firing on all cylinders, so why stop?</p>
                <p>Opportunities aren't evenly distributed across the week, month, or quarter.</p>
                <p>When conditions are right, you <span class="emp">press your advantage‚Ä¶</span> because who knows when the next prime market rhythm will come?</p>
                <h4>Option 2: Lock It In & Walk Away</h4>
                <p>Taking profits when you're up big <span class="key">protects your <strong>P&L</strong> <span class="emp">and</span> your <strong>mindset</strong></span>.</p>
                <p>Because nothing feels worse than <span class="emp">going from king of the market to questioning your entire existence</span> in a matter of hours‚Ä¶ (hands up please!)</p>
                <p>And the <span class="key"><strong>psychological damage</strong> of giving back gains?</span> Brutal. Sometimes, it's just not worth the risk for a little extra.</p>
                <p class="emp">So‚Ä¶ which is right?!</p>
                <p>Well‚Ä¶ in true trading fashion. It depends.</p>
                <ul class="custii emp">
                    <li>Where are you in your trading journey?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Huh? Why does that matter, Mark?</p>
                <p>Because sometimes, <span class="emp"><strong>protecting confidence</strong> is more important than squeezing out extra gains.</span></p>
                <p>If you're still building your confidence bank, the risk vs. reward of making a little more <span class="emp">versus giving back your gains</span> probably isn't worth it.</p>
                <p>But if you're more advanced and comfortable with the trade-off? Maybe pressing harder is the right move.</p>
                <p>It's a <span class="emp">very</span> personal decision.</p>
                <h4>Let's Figure This Out‚Ä¶</h4>
                <p>In my latest podcast, I break down this dilemma and some smart ways to handle it.</p>
                <p>Here's what we cover:</p>
                <ul class="cust">
                    <li><span class="emp">The psychology of giving back profits</span> (and how to avoid the emotional spiral)</li>
                    <li><span class="emp">Smart ways to set intraday loss limits,</span> without trading scared</li>
                    <li><span class="emp">When to keep your foot on the throttle</span> (and when to step off)</li>
                    <li><span class="emp">The one mindset shift</span> that keeps your equity curve moving in the right direction</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because let's be honest‚Ä¶ <span class="emp">nothing stings more than being up big, feeling on top of the world, only to give it all back by the close.</span></p>
                <p>If that's ever happened to you (or keeps happening), this is worth a listen.</p>

The RBNZ meeting will be a risk event to manage through trade today, with the bank almost certainly set to cut rates by 50bp - again, the move in the NZD today will likely come from the RBNZ's guidance and appetite for further easing and how it reconciles to the additional 63bp of rate cuts implied by December.</p>

                    <h3>LOVE TRADING</h3>
                    <div class="img50">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Feb/Love trading.jpg" alt="Love trading">
                    </div>
                    <p class="fsi">‚ÄúAlright, genius Mark, how does loving what I do hold me back?‚Äù</p>
                    <p>Well, a lot of traders love <span class="emp">trading</span>, and by that, I mean clicking the button, being in a trade, feeling alive from the P&L swings.</p>
                    <p>And those traders?</p>
                    <p>They typically <strong>overtrade</strong>, <strong>overleverage</strong>, and fall into bad habits.</p>
                    <p class="fsi">(This is how we all start, by the way‚Ä¶so don't sweat it if this sounds like you.)</p>
                    <p>But if you can learn to <span class="emp">love other aspects of trading</span>, you can <span class="key">channel that energy into the right places‚Ä¶</span></p>
                    <p>Instead of loving the thrill of the trade, love the thrill of:</p>
                    <ul class="custiii">
                        <li><span class="emp">Preparation</span>‚Äîbuilding a rock-solid trading plan.</li>
                        <li><span class="emp">Research & backtesting</span>‚Äîuncovering edges that actually work.</li>
                        <li><span class="emp">Journaling & reviewing</span>‚Äîlearning from every trade, refining execution.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I know, I know‚Ä¶ You might be thinking, <span class="emp">‚ÄúBooooooring!‚Äù</span></p>
                    <p>But, <span class="key">if you can find joy in the <strong>process</strong></span> and <span class="key"><strong>detach</strong> from the excitement of being in a trade</span>, you'll be <span class="key">less <strong>impulsive</strong></span>, <strong>calmer</strong>, <span class="key">more in <strong>control‚Ä¶</strong></span> and a way better trader for it.</p>
                    <p>There's nothing wrong with loving trading, you need to!</p>
                    <p>But if you <span class="key"><strong>channel</strong> that <strong>'love'</strong> into the <strong>right areas</strong></span>, <span class="key">it will <strong>serve you</strong>, not <strong>sabotage</strong> you.</span></p>
                    <p>So, instead of chasing the <span class="emp">rush</span> of a trade‚Ä¶</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>&#x2705; <span class="emp">Love the craft:</span> <span class="key"><strong>Honing</strong> your <strong>execution</strong>, <strong>refining</strong> your <strong>edge</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li>&#x2705; <span class="emp">Love the discipline:</span> <span class="key">Sticking to your <strong>rules</strong>, managing <strong>risk</strong> like a trading samurai.</span></li>
                        <li>&#x2705; <span class="emp">Love the process:</span> <strong>Journaling</strong>, <strong>reviewing</strong> and <span class="key">continuously <strong>improving</strong></span>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Because the traders who fall in love with <span class="emp">process over thrill</span>?</p>
                    <p>They're the ones who last.</p>
                    <p>So ask yourself:</p>

                <p>Ever watched a trading video, thought <span class="fsi">‚ÄúThat's gold‚Äù</span>‚Ä¶ and then completely forgot to apply it?</p>
                <p>Or maybe you saved a good video, knowing it's probably packed with value, but never got around to watching it?</p>
                <p>We've all been there‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>Most traders watch YouTube, nod along, and then‚Ä¶ nothing changes. They know what to do but don't actually <span class="emp">do it</span>.</p>
                <p>There's a better way:</p>
                <ul class="custiii">
                    <li>Find a solid video from someone you respect</li>
                    <li>Grab the <strong>transcript</strong> (<span class="key">YouTube auto-generates captions</span>‚Äîjust copy & paste)</li>
                    <li>Use <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to <span class="key">extract <strong>key</strong> takeaways</span></li>

                </ul>

                    <img src="./assets/images/Feb/How to use ChatGPT to extract key takeaways.png" alt="How to use ChatGPT to extract key takeaways">
                </div>
                <p>For example, I took a 3-minute video from trading psychologist <strong>Brett Steenbarger</strong> and turned it into this <span class="emp">post-trade checklist</span>:</p>
                <p>&#x1F4FA;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkAC4FNf54" target="_blank">Reviewing Trading Performance</a></p>
                <p class="key">After copying the <strong>transcript</strong> into <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, use this <strong>prompt</strong>:</p>
                <ul class="custii">
                    <li>‚Äú<span class="fsi">Here is a transcript from a trading video. Summarise the key takeaways and create an actionable checklist that a trader can use to apply these insights in real-time. The checklist should be simple, practical, and structured for daily use</span>.‚Äù</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then let AI do its magic‚Ä¶ <span class="key">tweak if needed</span>, and you get something like this:</p>
                <h4>Post-Trade Review Checklist</h4>
                <ul class="non key">
                    <li>&#x2705; Did I trade the right <strong>setup</strong>? (Best <strong>opportunity</strong>? Good <strong>risk-reward</strong>?)</li>
                    <li>&#x2705; Did I <strong>execute</strong> well? (Good <strong>entry</strong>? Proper <strong>size</strong>? Followed my <strong>plan</strong>?)</li>
                    <li>&#x2705; Did I <strong>manage</strong> it right? (Adjusted for market <strong>volatility</strong>? Took <strong>profits</strong> correctly?)</li>
                    <li>&#x2705; Did I stick to my <strong>rules</strong>? (Or did emotions take over?)</li>
                    <li>&#x2705; What's one thing I'll <strong>improve</strong> next session? (And how will I <strong>apply</strong> it?)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pretty good‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>Now, imagine doing this for:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üî• Mark Douglas on <span class="key">risk management</span></li>

                    <li>üî• Jason Shapiro on <strong>strategy</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="fsi">(I actually ran an hour-long Jason Shapiro video through ChatGPT and asked it to <strong>summarise</strong> his <strong>strategy</strong> into a <span class="emp">simple trading plan‚Ä¶</span> it did a really nice job of distilling his approach down into <span class="key">simple <strong>rules</strong></span>.)</p>
                <p>Anyway, the sky's the limit here.</p>
                <p>You can <span class="emp">work backwards</span> from what you want to <strong>improve</strong> and <span class="key">hunt down the right video</span>, or <span class="emp">watch something valuable</span> and turn it into a <span class="key">structured <strong>process</strong></span>.</p>
                <p>Either way, hopefully you can see how <strong>useful</strong> this can really be.</p>

                    <p>‚ÄúHe must have the <strong>nerve</strong> to stand a series of losses; <strong>persistence</strong> to keep him at the work during adverse periods; <strong>self-control</strong> to avoid overtrading; a <strong>phlegmatic</strong> disposition to ballast and balance him at all times.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="fsi">- Studies in Tape Reading by Richard D. Wyckoff</p>

                    <p>Traders overtraded. They let losses rattle them. They hesitated. They went on tilt.</p>
                    <p class="key">And Wyckoff knew exactly what separated the wheat from the chaff:</p>
                    <ul class="custiv emp">

                    <p>Same game, different tools. The ones who mastered these? They made it happen.</p>

                    <p class="key">If you can just stay <strong>dialled in</strong>, you'll put yourself ahead of 90% of traders out there.</p>

                <p>Let's get right to it:</p>
                <p class="key">So most traders don't know what they don't know right?</p>
                <p>Sounds obvious, but we all have blind spots, mistakes we don't even know we are making, and hidden trapdoors in our strategy waiting to catch us out.</p>
                <p>So how do you spot them?</p>
                <p>You could jump on our &#x1F4DC;<a href="https://www.tradersmastermind.com/complete-order/" target="_blank">Traders Mastermind</a> <span class="emp">calls on Thursdays</span> (<span class="fsi">shameless plug!</span>), but here's something you can do <span class="emp">right now‚Ä¶</span></p>
                <p>Let <span class="emp">ChatGPT do the heavy lifting</span> for you.</p>
                <p>Here's how:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Step 1: Train ChatGPT on Your Trading</h5>
                        <p>Before it can help you, it needs to understand you. Give it:</p>
                        <ul class="cust">
                            <li>Your trading experience (years, markets traded)</li>
                            <li>Your strategy (trend following, scalping, mean reversion, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Your biggest challenges (overtrading, hesitation, holding winners, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Your risk tolerance, trading timeframe, and mindset struggles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And anything else important you might give to a trading mentor or coach.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Step 2: Ask ChatGPT This Simple Question</h5>
                        <p>‚ÄúTell me 50 things I don't know that I should know about my trading.‚Äù</p>
                        <p>ChatGPT will analyse your data and reveal insights that could:</p>
                        <ul class="cust">
                            <li> Expose flaws in your execution</li>
                            <li>Identify patterns in your trading psychology</li>
                            <li>Spot gaps in your risk management and trade selection</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Step 3: Get Tactical & Go Deeper</h5>
                        <p>Once you have your 50 insights, push further:</p>
                        <ul class="cust">
                            <li>‚ÄúWhat's my biggest blind spot based on my answers?‚Äù</li>
                            <li>‚ÄúWhat execution mistakes am I making?‚Äù</li>

                    <p>Alright, so everyone's heard of the phrase <span class="emp">‚ÄúShort Squeeze‚Äù</span>.</p>
                    <p>But what does it really mean, and what are the mechanics behind it?</p>
                    <p>First, I want to differentiate slightly between a <span class="key">stock short squeeze</span> and a <span class="key">squeeze on, say, the indices (today's topic)</span>.</p>
                    <p>A stock short squeeze usually happens when the short float is very high, the stock is ripping to highs, and sometimes the shares loaned out are being recalled.</p>
                    <p>Check out <span class="key">The VW Short Squeeze</span> for a great example:</p>
                    <p>&#x1F4DC;<a href="https://internationalbanker.com/history-of-financial-crises/the-volkswagen-short-squeeze-2008/" target="_blank">The Volkswagen Short Squeeze (2008)</a></p>
                    <p class="fsi">‚ÄúHedge-fund managers reportedly compared the Porsche disclosure to a 'nuclear bomb going off in our faces.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
                    <p>Ha! Well, that doesn't leave any doubt about the impact!!</p>
                    <p>Anyway, back to the indices‚Ä¶</p>
                </main>
                <main>
                    <h3>SHORT SQUEEZE MECHANICS</h3>
                    <div class="img80">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Feb/Short squeeze mechanics.png" alt="Short squeeze mechanics">
                    </div>
                    <p>Ok, so no one really knows how or why other participants are positioned.</p>
                    <p>For every buyer, there must be a seller‚Ä¶ throw in hedging, options, and HFTs, and you have a smorgasbord of players with different incentives and objectives.</p>
                    <p>But in simple terms, here's a good way to look at the mechanics of a short squeeze:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bears see a break lower and start to pile onto the sell side, liquidating longs and initiating fresh short positions.</li>
                        <li>The market rebounds quickly, and it becomes clear that they've shorted into the hole.</li>
                        <li>So, not only do you have shorts in pain, not thinking about selling more, at best waiting to see what happens, or more likely <span class="emp">buying to reduce their risk‚Ä¶</span></li>
                        <li>Plus, you have sidelined bulls who've been waiting for a signal to press‚Ä¶ they get long too.</li>
                        <li>Mid-term longs start to buy more.</li>
                        <li>Short-term traders start buying specifically because they see the short squeeze unfolding.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="emp">Result?</p>
                    <p>Very few sellers and an extreme supply/demand imbalance (for now).</p>
                    <p>Think about how price moves, if buyers are willing to pay higher and higher prices and sellers are happy to wait for better prices, you have a perfect storm.</p>
                    <p>Only when buyers back off the throttle and sellers start to think they need to get more aggressive with their offloads does price stall or reverse.</p>
                    <p>We don't get these often, but when we do, I think it's a <span class="emp">potential golden opportunity</span>.</p>
                    <p>When you look at a chart, ask yourself <span class="emp">‚ÄúWho is hurting the most here‚Äù</span></p>
                    <p>If there's been a dip that's reversed hard, it could be the shorts in a vice, and they need to cover‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Keep it on your radar.</p>

            <main>
                <h3>THE MOST DANGEROUS</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Feb/The most dangerous.png" alt="The most dangerous">
                </div>
                <p class="fsi">‚ÄúThe most dangerous person in the world is the one who shows up every single day, even when the rewards are uncertain.‚Äù</p>
                <p>And honestly? Sahil didn't mean it this way, but that applies to trading more than almost anything else.</p>
                <p>Think about it.</p>
                <p>Most traders want certainty. Right?</p>
                <p>They want a system that works <span class="fsi">all the time</span>, a strategy that never fails, an entry signal that guarantees a win.</p>
                <p>But we both know the market is not like that‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>As Steve Ward said whilst on my podcast <span class="fsi">‚ÄúGet comfortable being uncomfortable‚Äù</span></p>
                <p>&#x1F3A7;<a href="https://www.tradersmastermind.com/trading-psychology-steve-ward-building-a-professional-traders-mindset/" target="_blank">Trading Psychology: Steve Ward - Building A Professional Traders Mindset</a></p>
                <p>That's the game.</p>
                <p class="key">The reason trading can be so lucrative is that we get rewarded for the uncertainty.</p>
                <p>Want certainty? Buy a government bond or stick your money in a savings account, and you'll get your 4% per year, guaranteed.</p>
                <p>But the real juice? That's in <span class="key">embracing uncertainty</span>.</p>
                <p>The best traders don't need certainty. They <span class="fsi">thrive</span> in uncertainty.</p>
                <p>It's <span class="key">showing up</span>, <span class="key">doing the work</span>, and <span class="key">tolerating uncertainty</span> <span class="fsi">better than the next guy</span>.</p>
                <p>Because the trader who can sit through that uncertainty?</p>
                <p>He's the one who eventually <span class="fsi">wins</span>.</p>

                <p class="fsi">Stop making trading harder than it needs to be.</p>
                <p>Especially when it comes to discipline.</p>
                <p>Here's an analogy:</p>
                <p>Imagine you're trying to lose weight, but you sit there staring at a fresh pizza or a big chocolate cake all day.</p>
                <p>You only need to crack <span class="fsi">once</span>, and you've slipped up.</p>
                <p>You just wouldn't do that, right? You wouldn't sit there battling the urge, whispering, <span class="fsi">‚ÄúJust one bite won't hurt‚Ä¶‚Äù</span></p>
                <p>The same goes for trading.</p>

                </div>
                <p>If you're trying to reduce impulsive trades, why sit there watching every tick, letting FOMO creep in?</p>
                <p class="key">Walk away. Set alerts. Step back.</p>
                <p>If you're working on <span class="emp">holding trades longer</span>, why sit there staring at your P&L, broker platform open, mouse hovering over the close button?</p>
                <p>One moment of weakness, and boom‚Ä¶you're out.</p>
                <p class="fsi">‚ÄúArgh, price is pulling back!‚Äù</p>
                <p>Before you can calm down and rationalise why you should hold, you've already clicked exit.</p>
                <p>So‚Ä¶ make life easier.</p>
                <p>Sure, you could lose weight while staring at a chocolate cake all day and repeating ‚ÄúMust not eat‚Ä¶ must not eat‚Ä¶‚Äù. But let's be frank, that's the hard way.</p>
                <p>Trading is the same.</p>
                <p>You don't get extra points for making it difficult.</p>
                <p>Think about <span class="key">what you're trying to achieve</span>, then <span class="key">structure your trading environment</span> to help you succeed.</p>

                    <p>If you prefer slow, methodical decision-making and working off daily charts, you could be given the best scalping strategy in the world, but you'd second-guess entries, miss signals, and get frustrated.</p>

                <p>So, how do you cut through the noise and focus on what actually moves the needle?</p>
                <p>Here's a simple tactic to try:</p>

                <h3>THE MONTHLY THEME STRATEGY</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Mar/The monthly theme strategy.jpg" alt="The monthly theme strategy">
                </div>
                <p>At the start of the month, decide on <span class="emp">one key area</span> to focus on.</p>
                <p>It could be operational:</p>
                <ul class="cust">
                    <li>Holding trades longer</li>
                    <li>Trading bigger size</li>
                    <li>Testing a new strategy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It could be psychological:</p>
                <ul class="cust">
                    <li>Reducing FOMO</li>
                    <li>Eliminating revenge trading</li>
                    <li>Mastering discipline</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Or even curiosity-based:</p>
                <ul class="cust">
                    <li>How hedge funds operate</li>
                    <li>The biggest market moves in history</li>
                    <li>Understanding options pricing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                <p class="key">Once you pick your theme, every single piece of content you consume must align with it.</p>
                <p>That means‚Ä¶</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>&#x274C; No random gold scalping tutorials</li>
                    <li>&#x274C; No getting sucked into the latest strategy videos</li>
                    <li>&#x274C; No scrolling X for market drama</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Instead‚Ä¶</p>
                <ul class="cust">
                    <li>You filter out the noise</li>
                    <li>You absorb content that actually helps you progress</li>
                    <li>You train your brain to stay laser-focused on solving <span class="emp">one problem</span> at a time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And if you come across a video, podcast, or article that looks interesting but isn't aligned with your theme?</p>
                <p>No problem. <span class="emp">Bookmark it. Save it for later.</span></p>
                <p>But today? You're locked in. Nothing derails your focus.</p>
                <p>In a noisy world, it's worth a try‚Ä¶</p>

                </div>
                <p>Here's my take:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>&#x2705; <span class="emp">Simplicity</span> comes from your strategy, checklist, rules, and trade thesis.</li>
                    <li>&#x274C; <span class="emp">Complexity</span> doesn't come from the strategy itself‚Ä¶it comes from thinking ahead.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The best traders aren't just reacting to price; they're anticipating the next few moves.</p>
                <p>This ability to think multiple steps ahead helps you:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>&#x1F539; Pinpoint better trade opportunities</li>
                    <li>&#x1F539;  Stay out of noise and avoid unnecessary trades</li>
                    <li>&#x1F539; Train your <span class="fsi">prediction muscle</span> to improve decision-making</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>&#x2659; If price breaks this key level, what are the three most likely scenarios?</li>
                    <li>&#x2659; Which presents the best trade opportunity?</li>
                    <li>&#x2659; How can I structure my trade to capitalise on it?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thinking like this shifts you from <span class="fsi">random execution</span> to <span class="fsi">strategic precision</span>.</p>
                <p>I dive deeper into this in my latest podcast episode:</p>

                        <li>&#x2705; A strong mindset, iron discipline, and emotional control.</li>
                        <li>&#x2705; An effective strategy with edge.</li>
                        <li>&#x2705; Solid risk management.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You need all three, or the foundation will just collapse.</p>
                    <p class="key">And one thing that messes with all of these? <strong>Distractions.</strong></p>
                    <p>Noise, noise everywhere, constantly pulling your attention away from what really matters.</p>
                    <p>Think about it, your most valuable resources as a trader are <span class="emp">focus, capital, energy, and confidence</span>.</p>
                    <p>And they must be channelled into the one thing that's going to give you the highest chance of success.</p>
                    <p class="key">Spread yourself too thin, and you become just another liquidity provider.</p>
                    <p>So, a successful trader's superpower? <span class="emp">Focus.</span> Filtering out the noise. Protecting your resources for <span class="emp">what actually moves the needle</span>.</p>
                    <p>But how do you do that in a world filled with noise and volatile price action?</p>

                    <p>When price is persistently below a 5-day Moving Average that's telling you something meaningful‚Ä¶. a big reprice is underway, and trying to be smart getting long is probably a trap.</p>

                <p>For example, you might say something like:</p>
                <div class="hlt">
                    <p>‚ÄúI'm a day trader, and you're my risk manager. At 10 AM each day, ask me these questions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Am I trading according to plan today, or have I gone off-track?</li>
                        <li>If I've had an early loss, am I <strong>calm</strong> and <strong>clear-minded</strong> or frustrated and at risk of tilt?</li>
                        <li>Am I dialled into the market, or should I step away until I'm back in sync?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Wait for my answers before continuing, and after we're done, summarise your thoughts and give me an insightful quote from a Stoic philosopher.‚Äù</p>
                </div>
                <p>You can tweak that script to fit your own trading style and issues.</p>
                <p>Maybe you want that reminder at specific key times in the trading day. (<span class="fsi">Just after the open, Europe close, pre data, before the closing bell‚Ä¶ you get the idea.</span>)</p>
                <p>Sure, it's early days and a bit clunky, but think about the <span class="emp">eventual possibilities here</span>.</p>
                <p>Imagine if this could be seamlessly integrated right into your trading platform, tracking your trades, spotting patterns, and calling you out before you go on tilt.</p>
                <p>Now imagine it's hooked up to the market feed too!</p>
                <div class="d-hlt">
                    <p>üö® "<span class="emp">Bro, better calm down‚Ä¶ you've taken two quick losses, the market is choppy. Wait for the Europe close.</span>" üòÄ</p>
                </div>
                <p>Anyway, that's the future‚Ä¶but even right now, this is a solid way to keep yourself accountable. Try it out.</p>
                <p>Have you got any neat tricks with ChatGPT or do you prefer other AI tools?</p>
                <p>Let me know and I'll share the best.</p>
                <p>We're all on this AI-powered trading journey together!</p>

                <p>Rather than chasing big wins, he became <span class="emp">obsessed with capital preservation</span>.</p>
                <p>He started <span class="emp">cutting losses fast</span> and playing <span class="emp">great defense</span>, which ultimately made him one of the most successful traders of all time.</p>
                <p>His philosophy?</p>
                <ul class="custii">
                    <li>‚Äú<span class="fsi">The most important rule of trading is to play great defense, not great offense.</span>‚Äù</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most traders <span class="emp">do the opposite‚Ä¶</span> they focus on making money, not <span class="fsi">keeping it</span>.</p>
                <p>And that's why they don't last.</p>
                <p>Because <span class="emp">if you don't protect your capital, you won't be around for the trades that matter</span>.</p>
                <p>And that doesn't just mean using a stop loss. It means:</p>
                <ul class="cust emp">
                    <li>Taking only high-quality trades</li>
                    <li>Being intentional about every decision</li>
                    <li>Respecting your capital like a hedge fund manager</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, let me ask you‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>Next time you put on a trade, are you thinking <span class="emp">defense first</span> or just focusing on the potential gain?</p>
                <p>Tudor Jones learned this the hard way.</p>

                    <p>Nvidia will be central to the MAG7 basket, and a look at the high timeframes and we see better buying support below $110, with signs that it may be putting in a short-term base. With Nvidia's GTC developers conference (due 17-20 March) in the market's sights - an event which has seen the share price rally 8% on average - one questions if traders cover shorts and look to layer into longs through the week and ahead of the GTC. Clearly, the overhang issues of export controls and tariff risk are still a risk keeping the would-be buyers of Nvidia's equity away and they remain the big known unknowns.</p>

                    <p>Trump <span class="emp">wants</span> lower rates. He's asked for them. He's complained about them.</p>
                    <p>He knows the Fed won't just hand him a cut on a silver platter, oh no, so‚Ä¶ what's the next best move?</p>
                    <p>Create enough <span class="emp">uncertainty</span> to push Powell's hand.</p>
                    <p>And let's be honest, Trump's no fool.</p>
                    <p>Whatever you think of him politically, he <span class="emp">understands markets</span>. He knows that:</p>
                    <ul class="custii">
                        <li>Tariffs create uncertainty.</li>
                        <li>Flip-flopping on policy rattles businesses.</li>
                        <li>Uncertainty isn't good for market confidence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If businesses can't plan cash flow or supply chains, they tighten up. The market wobbles.</p>
                    <p>Growth slows.</p>
                    <p>And if things start <span class="fsi">really</span> cracking? Well, JP <span class="emp">has</span> to step in.</p>
                    <p>The Fed always says they don't react to the stock market‚Ä¶ but they <span class="emp">do</span> react to the economy.</p>
                    <p>That's their job! (Apart from screwing over scalpers every Fed day)</p>
                    <p>If uncertainty drives a slowdown or recession fears ramp up, rate cuts become a real possibility.</p>
                    <p>And if Powell <span class="emp">does</span> cut?</p>
                    <p>Trump suddenly has what he wants, cheap money, confidence restored, and maybe even the <span class="emp">mother of all bull runs</span>. (<span class="fsi">And we've not even talked about US debt financing‚Ä¶</span>)</p>
                    <p>At that point, he could change the game.</p>
                    <p>Dial back the tariff talk. Reassure businesses. <span class="emp">Boom, markets rip.</span></p>
                    <p>Who knows‚Ä¶maybe it's just a conspiracy theory.</p>
                    <p>But as traders, <span class="emp">thinking about these angles matters.</span></p>

                    <p>In FX markets we see some signs of a potential turn in the USD with the DXY +0.4%, and after the 6% sell-off from the 13 Jan, we see the DXY in a consolidation phase, with price now pushing into the range highs of this recent consolidation phase. <span class="key">EURUSD is naturally key in driving moves in the DXY</span> and traders have been better to sell here, with the EURUSD spot rate bleeding lower from 1.0917 to 1.0815, with the buyers stepping back in through US trade and lifting rates by 40p or so.</p>
                    <p>It seems the market has lost some confidence to bid EURUSD into 1.1000 and the spot rate seems to be carving out a 1.0950 to 1.0800 range. As we head into the 2 April Trump reciprocal tariff announcement, there is an increased risk that market players trim back on USD shorts and look to run a more neutral position.</p>

                    <p>The market regime has shifted‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Ever since DJT came back into the picture, <span class="emp">everything's felt different.</span></p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>US equity markets? Under the cosh. (For now)</li>
                        <li>Europe? Ripping higher.</li>
                        <li>Gold? At fresh highs.</li>
                        <li>Any country in the tariff crosshairs? <span class="emp">Good luck holding a trade in that for more than a day or two.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Things have changed‚Ä¶and they'll keep changing. Again, and again.</p>
                    <p>And just when we start finding our groove‚Ä¶ the game changes.</p>
                    <p>(Heck, I still remember trading the Dow in H2 of '03‚Ä¶ it was stuck in a range with a daily ADR of less than 100 pts‚Ä¶ and spreads were like 10 pts‚Ä¶ I thought that was it, no more trading!)</p>
                    <p>So yeah‚Ä¶ if trading wasn't hard enough already, <span class="emp">regime shifts crank the dial even more.</span></p>
                    <p>But as active traders, how do we <span class="emp">adjust and adapt</span> without losing our stride, or worse, our edge?</p>

                    <p>Because in the final <span class="emp">Pepperstone webinar for March</span>, I'll be digging into exactly that.</p>

                    <h3>High-water mark for scary US investment deficit?</h3>
                    <p>One of the scariest numbers in world finance got even more frightening at the end of last year as America's skyrocketing investment deficit hit new highs. Whether it's now peaked is perhaps the most important question facing global markets today.</p>
                    <p>The main thrust of President Donald Trump's global economic policies is clearly directed toward the U.S.'s yawning trade deficit, as he seeks to stop "freeloading" foreign countries from undercutting U.S. producers by overvaluing the dollar, frustrating U.S. exports and relying on American consumers.</p>
                    <p>Valid or not, next week's sweeping U.S. import tariff hikes are aimed at correcting that.</p>
                    <p>Less talked about is the accounting flipside of the U.S. trade and current account shortfalls: the country's massive capital surplus. America, with its large, liquid capital markets, effectively imports more of the world's savings than U.S. savers send abroad to Europe, Asia or the developing world.</p>
                    <p>Put another way, the U.S. Net International Investment Position (NIIP) - or the difference in value between overseas holdings of U.S. assets and all the assets held overseas by Americans - has been ballooning for more than a decade.</p>
                    <p>According to Wednesday's update from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, that NIIP gap hit yet another record high at the end of 2024: $26.2 trillion, a whopping 88% of annual U.S. GDP. While the bulk of that increase was driven by relative price effects, it also involved almost $1.3 trillion of additional net flows to the United States.</p>

                    <p>Inside that bag are 10 folded pieces of paper.</p>
                    <p>On each one? A different trading strategy.</p>
                    <p>Things like:</p>

                        <li>&#x1F4C8; Opening Range Breakout</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>You stick your hand in the bag and pull out one strategy.</p>
                    <p>That's it. That's now <span class="emp">your</span> strategy for the next 90 days.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No changing.</li>
                        <li>No switching.</li>
                        <li>No tweaking the rules mid-trade.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You also get ¬£10,000 in starting capital.</p>
                    <p>And there are other traders playing too.</p>
                    <p>Whoever achieves the <span class="fsi">best risk-adjusted return</span> after 90 days‚Ä¶ Wins ¬£1,000,000.</p>
                    <p>So, no swinging for the fences.</p>
                    <p>No doubling down after a loser.</p>
                    <p>Just disciplined execution of <span class="fsi">your</span> strategy.</p>
                    <p>Now think‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>What would you do?</p>
                    <p>You'd probably:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>&#x2705; Figure out which markets give your strategy the best edge</li>
                        <li>&#x2705; Set clear risk parameters to maximise return <span class="fsi">without blowing up</span></li>
                        <li>&#x2705; Add time-of-day filters to only trade during prime conditions</li>
                        <li>&#x2705; Create rock-solid entry criteria and a clean exit plan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You'd get to work.</p>
                    <p>Test. Refine. Track. Review.</p>
                    <p>If Week 1 was a disaster, you wouldn't abandon it‚Ä¶you can't!</p>
                    <p>You'd adapt.</p>
                    <p>Adjust.</p>
                    <p>Find a way to make it work.</p>
                    <p class="emp">Now think about this‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Why not treat your <span class="fsi">real</span> trading like this?</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pick a strategy.</li>
                        <li>Give it 90 days.</li>
                        <li>Commit.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="key">Tweak only what's necessary.</p>
                    <p class="key">Review. Improve. Go again.</p>
                    <p>Most developing traders fail not because they picked the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù strategy‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>But because they never stayed with one long enough to master it.</p>
                    <p>So the question is:</p>
                    <p class="emp">What's your strategy in the bag?</p>
                    <p>And are you willing to <span class="fsi">actually</span> make it work?</p>

                <p>So‚Ä¶ for 20 years, the CIA ran a top-secret program called <span class="fsi">The Stargate Project</span>.</p>
                <p>Its goal?</p>
                <p>To investigate the use of <span class="emp">psychic phenomena</span> for military intelligence and espionage. (Yep, really.)</p>
                <p>And running alongside it?</p>
                <p>A lesser-known but equally fascinating program called <span class="emp">Gateway</span>.</p>
                <p>The aim?</p>
                <p>To explore how to access <span class="emp">intuition</span> by shifting brain states using visualisation, colours, and binaural beats.</p>
                <p class="emp">‚ÄúThis is all very interesting Mark, thank you for the history lesson‚Ä¶</p>

                        <h4>&#x1F3A7; Binaural Beats for Brainwave Control</h4>
                        <p>The Gateway Process used specific frequencies to shift brainwaves into focused, calm, or hyper-alert states.</p>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">As a trader:</span></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use <span class="emp">theta (4-6 Hz)</span> pre-market to reduce overthinking</li>
                            <li>Use <span class="emp">beta (16-20 Hz)</span> during live sessions for alertness and snap reactions</li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>üåà Color Visualisation to Shift States</h4>
                        <p>They trained subjects to associate colours with emotional states. A sort of mental shortcut.</p>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">As a trader:</span></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blue = calm</li>
                            <li>Green = steady focus</li>
                            <li>Red = attack mode</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Trigger these visual cues before entries or post-tilt to reset your state on demand.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>üßò Focus 10 - Mind Awake, Body Asleep</h4>
                        <p>A core Gateway technique. You stay fully conscious while the body enters deep relaxation. Zero tension. Full presence.</p>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">As a trader:</span></p>
                        <p>Use Focus 10 before the open to stay detached, patient, and sharp when the bell rings.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>üß† Affirmations and Subconscious Programming</h4>
                        <p>Gateway used affirmations in altered states to reprogram beliefs and boost mental performance.</p>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">As a trader:</span></p>
                        <p>Try this:</p>
                        <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">I trade with calm confidence. I follow my plan. I accept what the market gives</span>.‚Äù Repeat it in your morning routine‚Ä¶ or right before sleep.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>‚úçÔ∏è Session Journaling for Awareness</h4>
                        <p>Gateway subjects had to log each session, tracking shifts in awareness, emotions, clarity.</p>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">As a trader:</span></p>
                        <p>Don't just track P&L.</p>
                        <p>Log your <span class="emp">mental state, focus level, clarity, and emotional patterns.</span></p>
                        <p>Over time, you'll see what mindset leads to your best trades.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now I get it‚Ä¶ this might all sound a bit much.</p>
                <p>But the CIA studied this stuff for <span class="emp">over 20 years</span>.</p>
                <p>And even though Project Stargate and Gateway are officially shut down‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>I wouldn't be surprised if something similar is still running. (<span class="fsi">If I mysteriously disappear tomorrow, I'm probably in Virginia at CIA HQ</span>‚Ä¶)</p>
                <p class="emp">Might be worth giving it a try‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>And if it doesn't work for your trading, hey‚Ä¶ you might have a fallback career as a <span class="emp">hostage locator</span>.</p>

                    <h3>THE TICK INDEX</h3>
                    <div class="img50">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Apr/Day trading with the NYSE Tick Index.png" alt="Day trading with the NYSE Tick Index">
                    </div>
                    <p>I've used this on and off for 24 years. (<span class="fsi">I served my time trading the Dow using this as a tool to support scalp entries.</span>)</p>
                    <p>I'm not such a screen junkie these days‚Ä¶ but the recent price action has got me dusting off 'ye olde' intraday playbook, and TICK plays a key role‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Here's a webinar I recorded, breaking down how I use it:</p>
                    <p>&#x1F4FA; <a href="https://www.tradersmastermind.com/short-term-trading-strategies-using-the-tick-index/" target="_blank">Short Term Trading Strategies Using The TICK Index - A Day Trader's Quick Guide</a></p>
                    <p>Inside, I cover:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What the TICK Index is (and isn't)</li>
                        <li>How to interpret extreme readings</li>
                        <li>Specific intraday setups using the TICK</li>
                        <li>Why it's more of a <span class="fsi">market pulse</span> than a lagging indicator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Quick refresher: The TICK Index is a <span class="emp">real-time NYSE feed</span>, not a calculated indicator.</p>
                    <p>It tells you how many stocks are trading on an uptick vs downtick, giving you a feel for market strength or weakness <span class="fsi">right now</span>.</p>
                    <div class="img50">

                    <p>Anyway, I don't want to add noise to your trading, but if you're active on US indices, this might be worth a fresh look.</p>

                    <p>Markets move in waves.</p>
                    <p>Even in wild conditions like these, there's still a <span class="emp">rhythm</span>, a structure to the way volatility expands, contracts, trends, and pulls back.</p>
                    <p>But that rhythm can shift quickly.</p>
                    <p class="emp">Sometimes intraday.</p>
                    <p>And if you're always reacting, constantly adjusting, and trading based on the <span class="fsi">last</span> market feel, you're likely one step behind.</p>

                    <h4>THE FIX: FILTERS</h4>
                    <p>What helps?</p>
                    <p>A filter-based approach.</p>
                    <p>Instead of guessing the mood of the market, <span class="key">let the data decide for you.</span></p>
                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <ul class="custii">
                        <li><span class="fsi">If ATR is elevated and we're breaking out on a higher timeframe ‚Üí hold for extended targets</span>.</li>
                        <li><span class="fsi">If price is range-bound and there's key econ data tomorrow ‚Üí look for A-to-B plays only</span>.</li>
                        <li><span class="fsi">Above VWAP? Long bias only. Below? Short bias - unless there's a clean exhaustion reversal</span>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Simple, adaptable filters like these help you <span class="emp">sync with the current flow</span>, <span class="key">not your feelings.</span></p>

                        <h5>Jesse Livermore</h5>
                        <p>üó£ ‚Äú<span class="fsi">The big money is not in the buying and the selling‚Ä¶ but in the waiting</span>.‚Äù</p>

                    <li>
                        <h5>2. Paul Tudor Jones</h5>
                        <p>üó£ ‚Äú<span class="fsi">I believe the very best money is made at the market turns. Everyone says you get killed trying to pick tops and bottoms, and you make all your money by playing the trend in the middle. Well for twelve years I have been missing the meat in the middle but I've made a lot of money at tops and bottoms</span>.‚Äù</p>
                        <p>‚Üí Timing the turning points ‚Äî contrarian entries when others are late. But with caution! Maybe now is not the best time to explore that style‚Ä¶</p>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Stanley Druckenmiller</h5>
                        <p>‚Äãüó£ ‚Äú<span class="fsi">It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong - and timing is a big part of that</span>.‚Äù</p>
                        <p>‚Üí Your timing amplifies or destroys the P&L profile of a trade. Pick your spots carefully, and that means sitting on your hands a lot.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Marty Schwartz (Pitbull)</h5>
                        <p>‚Äãüó£ ‚Äú<span class="fsi">I always laugh at people who say, 'I've never met a rich technician.' I love that! It's such an arrogant, nonsensical response. I used fundamentals for nine years and got rich as a technician</span>.‚Äù</p>
                        <p>‚Üí Schwartz was known for timing entries with price confirmation - technical tools can give you the 'when'. Consider a filter + trigger approach.</p>

                        <p>‚Äã‚Üí A fan favourite and for good reason. His contrarian timing is based on unexpected price reactions to expected news. Well worth thinking about in this current headline-driven environment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Mark Minervini</h5>
                        <p>üó£ ‚Äú<span class="fsi">The difference between a good trade and a great trade is timing</span>.‚Äù</p>
                        <p>‚Üí He's big on tight entries and waiting for the right trigger condition.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Linda Raschke</h5>
                        <p>üó£ ‚Äú<span class="fsi">Good timing comes from a feel for the rhythm of the market. You can't teach it - you develop it by watching price action for thousands of hours</span>.‚Äù</p>
                        <p>‚Üí <span class="gld">Timing is intuition built through repetition.</span> <span class="key">Screentime is priceless.</span></p>

                    <p>This all partly reflects the alarming levels of uncertainty and fears about the direction of the U.S. economy, but some economists reckon the move is also a matter of simple math. If Washington is intent on wiping out the U.S. trade deficit, it also has to accept an evaporation of the counter-balancing capital surplus, essentially the excess of overseas investments in America over U.S. investments abroad.</p>

                    <p>You don't want to chase it (smart).</p>
                    <p>But you also don't want to miss the move (also smart).</p>
                    <p>So, on the fly, you calibrate and build a few trading ideas, like this:</p>

                                <li><span class="emp">Trigger:</span> Buy first green candle after that pullback</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="emp">Filter:</span> Price pulls back and breaches an upsloping VWAP between 3:30-6:30 pm UK</li>
                                <li><span class="emp">Trigger:</span> Buy as price reclaims VWAP</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Afternoon Breakout</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="emp">Filter:</span> Price consolidates above VWAP and holds gains through the session</li>
                                <li><span class="emp">Trigger:</span> Buy breakout to new highs after 6 pm UK</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>The Trap</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="emp">Filter:</span> Price trends higher for 4+ hours, then reverses sharply</li>
                                <li><span class="emp">Trigger:</span> Short on a break below the day's low</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Different ideas. Same structure:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>&#x2705; A clear <span class="emp">filter</span> and <span class="emp">trigger</span></li>
                        <li>&#x2705; Proactive, not reactive</li>
                        <li>&#x2705; Built for the market you <span class="fsi">have</span>‚Ä¶ not the market you <span class="fsi">wish</span> for!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's about <span class="emp">creating clarity fast</span> and planning your next move, under pressure, without chasing price or panicking into a trade.</p>
                    <p>Whether that's a quick scalp, or trying to get a leg in on a multi-day mover.</p>
                    <p>So, as the week unfolds‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="emp">Try thinking in the filters and triggers framework.</p>
                    <p>Ask yourself: ‚Äú<span class="fsi">Based on what I see right now, what would my filter and trigger need to be for me to take the next trade</span>?‚Äù</p>
                    <p>Let that guide your decisions, not the noise.</p>

                    <p>In a world of such dramatic fundamental policy and economic disruptions, financial chart patterns and trends may seem a little beside the point. But some of these remain important for investment funds and strategists who rely on market momentum signals. One of the most basic is how the stock market is trading relative to its long-term 200-day moving average. The S&P500 fell below this on March 11 and has lost more than 500 points since then as the tariff war ensued. Another closely watched momentum signal is when the shorter-term 50-day average moves above or below the 200-day line. And it's now about to slice below it for the first time in more than a year, a move ominously dubbed a "Death Cross". The last time this happened in 2022, the S&P500 lost almost 1,000 points over the subsequent six months.</p>

                        <li>US Treasury (UST) 10 & 30yr yields trade higher, traders sell the USD vs EUR, JPY and CHF on the idea of USD repatriation flows.</li>
                        <li>UST yields lower, US equity higher/vol lower - traders sell the USD vs risk/high beta FX (NZD, ZAR, AUD MXN).</li>
                        <li>UST yields lower and equity lower/vol up, traders sell USDs vs JPY, CHF and EUR on relative haven demand - albeit, less so the CHF given the SNB may soon intervene in the FX markets.</li>

                    <p>Last week, volatility hit new highs, driven by sharp moves in equity indices, FX, gold, and the USD. This environment was tailor-made for traders ‚Äî and they responded:</p>

                <p>ChatGPT has been busy doing all sorts of updates recently.</p>
                <p>To be frank, most of it doesn't really apply to us traders.</p>

                <p>Yep, ChatGPT can now remember what you've told it over time.</p>
                <p>Put the privacy argument to one side for a sec (we ain't got time to open that can of worms!)‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>This is actually a <span class="fsi">very</span> handy upgrade for traders.</p>
                <p>Why?</p>
                <p>Because the more context and detail you give it over time, the more helpful and tailored it becomes.</p>
                <p>So, if you've been uploading your journal, talking through psychology issues, and logging patterns, it can now start to spot themes and give you <span class="fsi">more-specific</span> feedback.</p>
                <p>Eventually, I reckon it'll factor in market conditions too.</p>
                <p class="emp">Imagine this:</p>
                <p>It's pre-market. The Nasdaq is gapping up.</p>

                <p>Yes, it's tough.</p>

                <p class="emp">You're human.</p>
                <p>One day, it's like water off a duck's back.</p>

                    <img src="./assets/images/Apr/How to manage it.jpg" alt="How to manage it">
                </div>
                <p>Most traders fall into the trap of thinking we need to eliminate all emotion. (<span class="fsi">Hands up, I used to think this</span> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)</p>
                <p>That's wrong.</p>
                <p>Yes, over time, you become desensitised to certain triggers. But just like with road rage, your reaction depends on all kinds of things‚Ä¶</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üò¥ How well you slept.</li>
                    <li>üòñ How stressed you are.</li>
                    <li>üïö Whether you've already had a tough morning.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of it adds up.</p>
                <p>So here's the key:</p>
                <p>You can't <span class="fsi">control</span> when emotion shows up.</p>
                <p>But you <span class="fsi">can</span> learn to recognise it‚Ä¶ and respond proactively.</p>
                <p>Missed fill?</p>
                <p>Got pinged out to the tick, and then price ran without you?</p>
                <p>Whatever it is‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>When you feel that emotion starting to build, do something <span class="fsi">now</span> to stop it bleeding into your next decision.</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üìâ Step away</li>
                    <li>üßò Do breathwork</li>
                    <li>üîª Dial down size</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="emp">Just something to reset.</p>
                <p>Because it's not about being emotionless.</p>
                <p class="key">It's about having a system for getting back to clear, focused execution <span class="fsi">despite</span> how you feel.</p>
                <p>However you did this week, take some time to review, reflect‚Ä¶ and then relax. And if, during that reflection, you realise too many trades were driven by emotion. <span class="emp">Maybe now's the time to build a better defence against it.</span></p>

                    <div class="img50">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Apr/The perfect journal.png" alt="The perfect journal">
                    </div>
                    <p class="emp">‚ÄúThen don't journal.‚Äù</p>
                    <p>He looked confused.</p>
                    <p>I'm sure he expected a lecture about how ‚Äúyou MUST journal if you want any chance of making it!‚Äù</p>
                    <p>But I didn't.</p>
                    <p>In a perfect world, sure‚Ä¶ every trader would meticulously journal every detail of every trade.</p>
                    <p>But I live in the real world.</p>
                    <p>I know you've got a job, a family, commitments.</p>
                    <p>And traditional journaling takes time, time pulled from something else.</p>
                    <p>If that's you, here's the simple answer:</p>
                    <p class="emp">You have 3 minutes.</p>
                    <p>And you don't even need to be at your desk.</p>
                    <ul class="custii">
                        <li>Open ChatGPT on your phone.</li>
                        <li>Start a new conversation.</li>
                        <li>Use advanced voice mode or just hit the mic icon.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>(<span class="fsi">Or if you prefer, use the notes app or record a quick voice memo</span>.)</p>
                    <p>And just <span class="emp">talk through your trading day</span> while it's fresh:</p>
                    <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">I bought the opening drive. Had my stop a bit tight. Got stopped. Market ranged for a while. I caught the break, but closed it too early</span>‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p>You get the idea.</p>
                    <p>No fancy tools.</p>
                    <p>No detailed stats.</p>
                    <p>Just a <span class="emp">real-time reflection</span>.</p>
                    <p>And here's what happens:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You relive the important moments of the day.</li>
                        <li>You see them from a calmer, post-session perspective.</li>
                        <li>You start to notice the same mistakes repeating.</li>
                        <li>You start to self-correct, naturally.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Because the real value of journaling isn't in the pretty charts.</p>
                    <p>It's in the self-awareness it creates.</p>
                    <p class="emp">If nothing else‚Ä¶ talking through your day for 3 minutes could save you months of spinning your wheels.</p>
                    <p>And my bet?</p>
                    <p>Once you start seeing the ROI from those 3 minutes, you'll naturally start going deeper and getting even more value out of it.</p>
                    <p>There's no ‚Äúright‚Äù way to trade.</p>
                    <p>Forget about what you <span class="fsi">should</span> be doing.</p>
                    <p>This week, find <span class="emp">your</span> groove, and make it happen.</p>

                <p>Where you sit on that spectrum depends on your style and personality‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>We were mid-curry at our favourite spot, praising capitalism, bashing socialism, as traders do‚Ä¶ When he said:</p>

                <p>‚ÄúWhat is he, a trader?‚Äù I asked, crunching on a poppadom.</p>

                <p><span class="fsi">Basic</span> Economics? Is he taking the p*&@!?</p>
                <p>But Peter insisted.</p>
                <p>‚ÄúNo, honestly, it's a really good read, it makes you think about things differently. Supply and demand, pricing, it's not a trading book but it's well worth your time‚Äù</p>
                <p>Now, Peter's not a man to make recommendations lightly, and I trust his judgement, so I ordered it on the spot.</p>
                <p>And‚Ä¶ It's <span class="emp">superb</span>.</p>
                <p>Sowell strips away jargon, tells brilliant stories, and gets you thinking differently about how prices form, why markets behave the way they do, and what actually moves the economy.</p>
                <p>As a trader, do you <span class="fsi">need</span> to read it?</p>
                <p>No.</p>
                <p>But should you?</p>
                <p>I reckon <span class="emp">yes</span>.</p>
                <p class="key">Understanding <strong>supply and demand</strong> at a deeper level helps, even if it just sharpens how you see price.</p>

                <h3>End of Month Shenanigans</h3>
                <p>Today's the final trading day of May. And May's been a beast for stock bulls.</p>
                <p>That means two forces might be in play:</p>
                <p><span class="emp">#1 Hedge funds have been scrambling to get back long</span> (they got caught out by the snap-back rally after selling, and have been paying up to get back on board)</p>

                <p>Bank of America said this:</p>
                <p>‚ÄúWe see ~$-42bn of rebalancing flows out of equities (‚Ä¶a material ~-2.0œÉ rebalancing month)‚Äù</p>
                <p>Translation?</p>
                <p class="emp">Mechanical equity selling.</p>
                <p>Now, to be fair, they also said:</p>
                <p>‚ÄúOnly part of the rebalancing is likely to be performed at month-end‚Ä¶ larger part happens at quarter-end.‚Äù</p>
                <p>So it might not all hit today, but still‚Ä¶ expect movement.</p>

                <h4>My Take üéØ</h4>
                <p>With all the macro noise, sentiment swings, and FOMO buying we've seen lately‚Ä¶</p>
                <p class="emp">Today could get spicy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Could be strong momentum, a last-day-of-the-month billy bonus if you can spot it, jump on and HOLD üçæ</li>
                    <li>It could also be messy chop, wick city, algo party stuff üå™Ô∏è</li>
                    <li>Either way, be alert. Let the price action tell you the true story. Oh, and that last 5-minute candle? Yeah, that's going to be fun ü§™</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="emp">Manage the risk.</p>
                <p>Don't throw away your whole month on one silly trade. üí™üèª</p>

                <p>VWAP isn't just some random line on a chart.</p>
                <p>It's how big players move serious size, without lighting up the tape.</p>
                <p>üìä According to BestEx Research, <span class="emp">72% of institutional traders use VWAP algos for low-urgency orders.</span> <a href="https://www.tradersmagazine.com/departments/brokerage/bestex-research-debuts-new-category-of-execution-algo/" target="_blank">BestEx Research Debuts 'New Category of Execution Algo'</a></p>
                <p>Why?</p>
                <p>Because the job of a VWAP algo is simple:</p>
                <p>üëâ <span class="emp">Fill the order at or better than VWAP.</span></p>
                <p>Let's break this down‚Ä¶see if we can find some edge here.</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>VWAP EDGE</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Jun/VWAP edge.png" alt="VWAP edge">
                </div>
                <p>Picture this‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>You're an algo with 10,000 contracts of Nasdaq futures to sell.</p>
                <p>You can't just slam the market, right? That would cause massive slippage.</p>
                <p>But NQ trades ~400k contracts a day, so if you <span class="emp">slice it up</span>, feed it slowly, and follow the volume, you might just get it done quietly‚Ä¶ and at a good average price.</p>
                <p>So you load the sell order into a VWAP algo.</p>
                <p>Now‚Ä¶ let's zoom in.</p>

                <h4>‚Äãüö® The Turning Point</h4>
                <div class="img80">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Jun/The turning point.png" alt="The turning point">
                </div>
                <p>The algo's been working the order all morning.</p>
                <p>Filled ~35% of the size.</p>
                <p>VWAP is sitting <span class="emp">nicely</span> below the current market.</p>
                <p>Life is good.</p>
                <p>But there's a problem:</p>
                <p>The clock's ticking, and price is drifting <span class="emp">too far above VWAP</span>.</p>
                <p>From the algo's point of view:</p>
                <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">I'm ahead of schedule and getting better-than-VWAP fills. Great. But I still have 65% left. Anything can happen. Let's get moving before this slips away</span>‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                <p>So it starts <span class="emp">selling more aggressively</span>:</p>
                <p>Hitting bids. Working harder. Getting filled faster. Other algos with similar orders start doing the same.</p>
                <p class="emp">And then?</p>
                <ul class="custii">
                    <li>Selling pressure increases</li>
                    <li>The market starts to roll</li>
                    <li>Price magnetises back to VWAP</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Not because the buyers vanished‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>But because the bots are doing their job.</p>

                <h4>‚Äãüìâ When Price Meets VWAP Again‚Ä¶</h4>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>The aggressive selling slows.</li>
                    <li>The algo calms down.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And ‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>üí° <span class="fsi">Buy-side</span> VWAP algos might now see price as attractive. So they quietly start working their orders too‚Ä¶ Adding subtle buying pressure right where the sell-side was just active.</p>
                <p>‚Äãüîç <span class="emp">So what's the takeaway for us?</span></p>
                <p>Understanding how and why VWAP algos behave gives you a real edge.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It explains those repeatable mid-day rolls.</li>
                    <li>It offers clues on hidden intent.</li>
                    <li>It helps you build plays around their behaviour.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>üìΩ <span class="emp">My ‚Äú6 o'clock shock‚Äù strategy</span> is built on this exact idea, riding the curl in price as the VWAP algos kick into more aggressive gear.</p>

                <p>Even if that play is not your thing, I think understanding the motivation and behaviour of 'big money' can really help you identify edge‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>So, I have to hold my hands up here‚Ä¶ I was slow to adopt market replay.</p>
                <p>Love tech, love AI‚Ä¶ but when it came to trade reviews, I stuck with printed charts and a pencil.</p>
                <p>Old habits‚Ä¶ (<span class="fsi">Still bitter about the time my data provider changed the Level 2 colours in 2010</span>) üò¨</p>
                <p>But now?</p>
                <p>I'm converted.</p>
                <p>Market replay is a game changer.</p>
                <p>It shows you things no journal or screenshot ever could:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What really happened before and after your entry</li>
                    <li>How price moved‚Ä¶ not how you remember it üòÅ</li>
                    <li>Where the execution could've been better</li>
                    <li>And the one tweak that changes everything next time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you want to explore market replay, here's the framework I've found to be pretty good‚Ä¶</p>
            </main>

                <h3>REPLAY FRAMEWORK</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Jun/Replay framework.png" alt="Replay framework">
                </div>
                <p>This weekend, replay 2 trades:</p>
                <p>Your <span class="emp">best</span> and your <span class="emp">worst</span>.</p>
                <p>(And ‚Äúworst‚Äù doesn't have to mean losing, it could be a rule break or missed exit.)</p>
                <p>Fire up replay. I use TradingView, and FYI, Pepperstone's running a <a href="https://pepperstone.com/en-af/go/ess-tvsub-3month/?cxd=39193_601480&utm_source=39193&utm_medium=Affiliates&utm_campaign=ESS-TVSUB-3month&utm_term=&utm_content=CX" target="_blank">free access deal</a> for clients, existing and new, right now.</p>
                <p>Then run through this checklist:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">What was I seeing at the time?</span></p>
                        <p>Narrate your thoughts before entry. What was the thesis, and what made you pull the trigger?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">What did price do just before/after?</span></p>
                        <p>Replay it slowly, did you miss any tells?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">Was the entry optimal?</span></p>
                        <p>Could you have waited? Entered better? Avoided it?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">What did I miss?</span></p>
                        <p>Context clues, time of day, VWAP, volume, HTF bias?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">How did I manage the trade?</span></p>
                        <p>Did you hold, size up/down, move stops?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">Where was the best exit?</span></p>
                        <p>Replay what happened after, where should/could you have reasonably closed?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">Was there a better variation of this idea?</span></p>
                        <p>Breakout vs pullback after breakout? Pinbar trap vs momentum ignition?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#x2705; <span class="emp">Key takeaway?</span></p>
                        <p>One tweak to apply next time this play appears.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Try it this weekend, just 20 minutes.</p>
                <p>Quick to do, massive ROI.</p>
                <p>This is the kind of work most traders skip‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>I've opened up <span class="emp">Traders Mastermind Premium</span>.</p>
                <p>Only for a short time, mainly because of the new Q3 Trading Pods I'm putting together.</p>

                <p>Linda Raschke was one of the first traders to give her setups names you couldn't forget.</p>
                <div class="d-hlt">
                    <p>ü©≥ <span class="emp">Short Skirt Trade</span> - Quick in and out before anyone notices.</p>

                </div>
                <p>And sure, the names are fun‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>But they're also powerful mental anchors.</p>
                <p>Because when you give your setups a sharp, memorable name, you give your subconscious a cue:</p>
                <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">This is that trade, with</span> <span class="emp">this</span> <span class="fsi">logic</span>, <span class="emp">these</span> <span class="fsi">rules</span>, <span class="fsi">and</span> <span class="emp">this</span> <span class="fsi">objective</span>.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="key">No more turning a scalp into a swing.</p>
                <p class="key">No more letting a strict setup become a vague 'maybe'.</p>
                <p>But naming them is the hard part.</p>
                <p class="emp">So, enter our good old friend ChatGPT‚Ä¶ with this prompt:</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>NAME YOUR SETUPS</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Jun/Name your setups.png" alt="Name your setups">
                </div>
                <p>Here's the prompt:</p>
                <p class="fsi">I want you to help me come up with a sharp, memorable name for a specific trading setup I use.</p>
                <p><span class="emp">The goal:</span> <span class="fsi">The name should act as a mental shortcut that instantly reminds me of the setup's core logic</span>.</p>
                <p class="fsi">It should reflect either:</p>
                <ul class="non fsi">
                    <li>- The pattern itself</li>
                    <li>- The intention behind the trade</li>
                    <li>- The constraints (time, signal, target, narrative)</li>
                    <li>- Or the emotional discipline required to execute it</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="fsi">Start by asking me:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="fsi">What is the setup?</span></li>
                    <li><span class="fsi">When do you take it?</span></li>
                    <li><span class="fsi">What's the entry trigger?</span></li>
                    <li><span class="fsi">What's the typical target?</span></li>
                    <li><span class="fsi">What makes this trade work ‚Äî or fail?</span></li>
                    <li><span class="fsi">Do you want the name to sound tactical, analytical, cheeky, clean, poetic, or prop-style?</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p class="fsi">Then give me 5-10 name options that reflect those answers ‚Äî mixing styles if useful ‚Äî and include a short line explaining why each name fits.</p>
                <p class="fsi">Make sure each name reinforces proper execution.</p>
                <p>You might need to tweak and reply a few times to get what you want, but it's worth doing.</p>
                <p>I used this to name one of my opening drive scalp plays.</p>
                <p class="emp">10AM Guillotine.</p>
                <p class="p-hlt">‚Äãüí• Brutal. Precise. Done by 10AM.</p>
                <p>That name reminds me exactly what this trade is <span class="fsi">supposed</span> to be.</p>
                <p>And that alone keeps me from overtrading it.</p>
                <p>Try it with one of your setups, see what it comes up with!</p>

                <p>When the U.S. struck Iran recently, traders scrambled to figure out the impact.</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>Would the oil spike hold?</li>
                    <li>Would equities crash?</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Most traders were guessing.</p>
                <p>Unless you're an expert in Middle East geopolitics‚Ä¶ it's all noise.</p>
                <p>But here's what I typed into ChatGPT:</p>
                <p>"<span class="fsi">How did oil, gold, equities, and USD respond during past Iran-related conflicts?</span>‚Äù</p>

                    <li>Strait of Hormuz attacks (2019): Oil +10%, faded quickly</li>
                    <li>Soleimani strike (2020): Crude spiked, gold ran, ES dipped, all reversed in days</li>
                    <li>Breakdown of timelines, price reactions, duration of moves</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then I asked:</p>
                <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">What did Iran do militarily after the U.S. killed Qasem Soleimani in 2020? Include missile strikes, cyberattacks, and how oil & equities responded.</span>‚Äù</p>
                <p>Now I'm a geopolitical analyst with data-backed context (minus the 10 hours of doomscrolling.) üòÅ</p>
                <p>What did I learn?</p>

                    <li>Closing the Strait was always unlikely</li>
                    <li>Oil spiked, equities wobbled‚Ä¶ then both cooled off fast</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Layer that into my trade ideas</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And this is just one use case‚Ä¶</p>

We're seeing minimal follow-through in Asia, but with the bull trend defined by the rising 5-day EMA, until we see a daily close below this short-term EMA, buyers should use intraday weakness to add to longs and the lofty target of 1.2000 is not unrealistic.</p>

                    <p>Still a misunderstood and underrated skill.</p>
                    <p>Some say it's just watching how price moves on a chart.</p>
                    <p>Others think it's staring at Level 2 and time & sales all day.</p>
                    <p>Truth is: it's both‚Ä¶ and neither. üòÅ</p>
                    <p>Personally? I've gone full circle on this.</p>
                    <p>Tape reading made me a trader 20 years ago. Then I shifted to bigger swings and let it go.</p>
                    <p>But in today's headline-driven, fast-shifting market?</p>
                    <p>It's back, baby!</p>
                    <p>So, I just recorded a podcast on what tape reading really is‚Ä¶ and how to bring it into your process without drowning in data.</p>
                    <p>Here's what I look for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Acceleration of price</li>
                        <li>Velocity of price change</li>
                        <li>Reactions at key levels</li>
                        <li>Micro-pauses before breakout</li>
                        <li>Failed pushes (a big tell)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's not magic. It's just reading intent.</p>
                    <p>If you've been meaning to explore tape, this one's for you:</p>

                    <h2>A 'Golden Cross' Triggered on the S&P500:</h2>
                    <p>Why Traders Should Look Elsewhere</p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                </header>
                <main>
                    <p>The financial media has been quick to highlight the recent ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù on the S&P 500 - where the 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed above the slower 200-day MA. While this crossover may be loosely viewed as a bullish entry signal, does it really offer positive expectancy for short-term CFD traders?</p>
                    <p>In my view, the answer is no.</p>
                    <p>By its nature, the golden cross signals that underlying index momentum is strong - something already evident in the price action. The S&P 500 has rallied an impressive 28% from the April lows, trading at new all-time highs. That alone tells us what we need to know: <span class="key">momentum is intact.</span></p>
                    <p class="key">For those deploying momentum or trend-following strategies, a shorter-term MA crossover system is arguably a better tool - either as a component in trade entry or more effectively, as a systematic exit trigger.</p>
                    <p class="key">One example: I use the 3- & 8-day EMA crossover as a clean exit strategy on higher timeframes. It helps reduce emotional decision-making, allowing me to stay in trending trades longer without the temptation to ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù and reload at wider spreads. Staying in the trend is the goal - simple systems like this help achieve it.</p>
                    <p>These basic signals may seem overly simplistic to some. Yet over time, many traders find themselves stripping back complex exit models to simpler rules: <span class="key">a moving average crossover, a trailing ATR stop, or a rolling 20-, 40-, or 65-day low. Clean. Objective. Repeatable.</span></p>
                </main>
                <main>
                    <h3>Does the Golden Cross Offer Any Edge?</h3>
                    <div class="img80">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Jul/Does the Golden Cross offer any edge.png" alt="Does the Golden Cross offer any edge">
                    </div>
                    <p>Let's test the golden cross historically on the S&P 500:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since January 2000, there have been 11 prior golden cross events.</li>
                        <li>If a trader had bought the S&P 500 on the day of the signal and held for 50 trading days, they would've been in the money 9 out of 11 times (82% win rate), with an average gain of 5%.</li>
                        <li>The two losing trades averaged a loss of -0.9%.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So yes, historically the golden cross aligns with further gains on average, but the sample size is statistically insignificant, and the signal is lagging by design.</p>
                    <p>Take the last golden cross on 2 February 2023 - the S&P 500 reversed sharply on the same day and fell 9.2% over the next 26 days.</p>
                </main>
                <main>
                    <h3>Why It Doesn't Work for Short-Term CFD Traders</h3>
                    <p>For short-term traders, especially in CFDs, the golden cross is too slow and lacks actionable timing precision. Markets today are far more dynamic , and the structure has changed dramatically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High-frequency trading (HFT) now accounts for 70-80% of S&P 500 daily volume.</li>
                        <li>0DTE options dominate, making up over 50% of daily notional options turnover.</li>
                        <li>Leverage ETF & other passive flows,  increasingly drive intraday volatility.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Add to that the constant real-time influence of Trump's social media posts, pending macro catalysts (like the OBBB Act, U.S. Q2 earnings season starting July 15), and data-driven market reactions, <span class="key">and it's clear: <strong>price</strong> is the first derivative and leads, not <strong>MAs</strong>.</span></p>
                    <p class="key">The S&P 500 has now rallied 832% since the 2009 lows - not because of golden crosses, but because buying weakness in a structurally rising market has worked. That's a far more powerful message for investors and traders alike.</p>
                </main>
                <main>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="key">Yes, historically golden crosses coincide with further gains. But for short-term traders, especially those using CFDs, this signal offers no real edge. Instead, focus on faster momentum signals, reactive price-based strategies, <span class="gld">or MA systems with a tighter lookback period.</span></p>

                    <p>Ever heard of <span class="emp">anchoring</span>? (Not the kind you do with your yacht off some private island‚Ä¶üòÅ)</p>
                    <p>It's the idea that you can take a specific <span class="emp">physical gesture</span>, like clenching your fist, tapping your chest, or gripping the steering wheel‚Ä¶ and <span class="emp">link it to a mental state</span>.</p>
                    <p>It's just Pavlov's dog, but make it‚Ä¶ performance psychology.</p>
                    <p>(You remember that one‚Ä¶ the bell rings, dog salivates.)</p>
                    <p>Same concept.</p>
                    <p>Except you're the dog. And the bell? That's whatever <span class="emp">trigger</span> you choose.</p>
                    <p>Tony Robbins bangs on about this a lot.</p>
                    <p>He'll get someone into a peak emotional state first. Think, power, focus, confidence and then get them to <span class="emp">anchor it</span> to a motion.</p>
                    <p>Touch your heart. Click your fingers. Clench your fist.</p>
                    <p>Do it enough times, and the body <span class="fsi">remembers</span>.</p>
                    <p>The trigger fires > state kicks in.</p>

                    <p>But here's the trick:</p>
                    <p>You have to <span class="emp">build the association first</span>.</p>
                    <p>Anchor the state when you're feeling it:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>&#x2705;After a great trade.</li>

                        <li>&#x2705;After reviewing a journal entry where you stuck to the plan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That's when you lock it in. You're not just feeling good, you're <span class="emp">teaching your system</span> what that feels like.</p>
                    <p>So, next time you're in that zone, calm, clear, dialled in. Pick a cue. Tap. Breathe. Press your fingers. Something simple and repeatable.</p>
                    <p>Then, before each trade: Trigger it.</p>
                    <p>Let it bring you back into that mental gear.</p>
                    <p class="emp">Do this consistently, and it becomes automatic.</p>
                    <p>The body leads. The mind follows.</p>
                    <p>Soon enough, like Pavlov's dog at the sound of a bell‚Ä¶ You'll find yourself stepping into discipline with a single cue.</p>
                    <p>(Not drooling‚Ä¶ üòÅ)</p>
                    <p>Give it a go. You might be surprised how well it works.</p>

                <p>And he's right‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>Whether you're a 'young' or erm 'not so young' trader, the reason you got into this business was because you believed you could make it happen.</p>
                <p>Right?</p>
                <p>Else, why would you bother?</p>
                <p>So, by that measure, we can assume most traders are driven, ambitious, and believe they have the character to win.</p>

                <h3>EXPECTATIONS</h3>

                </div>
                <p>Unlike, say, brain surgery or flying a 747‚Ä¶ there's basically zero chance you could do either of those without serious training. Years of it. Supervised. Structured.</p>
                <p>But trading?</p>
                <p>There's this slim chance you could do very well, very quickly.</p>
                <p>And that's where the real danger begins.</p>
                <p>Because, unlike flying a plane, where your incompetence is immediately obvious‚Ä¶üòÅ</p>
                <p class="emp">Trading gives you just enough success to believe you're different.</p>
                <p>A few green days. A lucky runner. One home-run setup that worked out perfectly.</p>
                <p>You start thinking, ‚Äú<span class="fsi">I've got this. I'm close</span>.‚Äù</p>
                <p>But now you're no longer just learning the craft. Now you're carrying <span class="emp">expectations</span>.</p>
                <p>And they're a heavy burden to bear:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You expect to grow your account every month.</li>
                    <li>You expect to bounce back quickly from drawdowns.</li>
                    <li>You expect to be immune to tilt, fear, hesitation.</li>
                    <li>You expect your potential to show up just because you <span class="emp">want it more than most</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Peter's right‚Ä¶ <span class="emp">nobody talks about this part</span>.</p>
                <p>Not the trades. The internal pressure.</p>
                <p>The voice that says:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>‚ÄúYou've been doing this too long to still be struggling.‚Äù</li>
                    <li>‚ÄúYou're better than this.‚Äù</li>
                    <li>‚ÄúYou <span class="fsi">should</span> be making X by now.‚Äù</li>
                    <li>‚ÄúPeople are watching.‚Äù</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That voice gets louder after a few wins. It doesn't go away with screen time. It grows with progress, and crushes you when the results don't match your expectations.</p>
                <p class="emp">The hardest part of trading isn't strategy.</p>
                <p>It's dealing with the gap between:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üß† What you <span class="fsi">think</span> should be happening‚Ä¶</li>
                    <li>Vs.</li>
                    <li>üìâ What's <span class="fsi">actually</span> happening.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="emp">Bridging that gap is the real work.</p>
                <p>It's not glamorous. It's not sexy. And nobody's posting about it.</p>
                <p>But it's the game.</p>
                <p>Keep showing up. Drop the self-imposed pressure.</p>
                <p class="emp">Mastery takes longer than your ego wants it to.</p>
                <p>Have a great (half) trading day.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Remember <span class="emp">Aatu Kokkila</span>?</p>
                <p>I interviewed him on the podcast a while back: &#x1F3A7;<a href="https://www.tradersmastermind.com/a-32-million-fund-managers-insights/" target="_blank">Aatu Kokkila: A ‚Ç¨32 Million Fund Manager's Insights on Trading Forex Mispricings During Key News Events</a></p>
                <p>He runs a fund that trades FX around mispricings during key news events. Here's the lowdown on his strategy, taken directly from his fund prospectus: <a href="https://team.alphanet.io/factsheet/s/thales/bjd5wbn/" target="_blank">Thales Performance Analysis</a></p>
                <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">The strategy seeks to exploit mispricings in the currency markets in relation to unexpected monetary policy decisions that could trigger further momentum or overreactions related to expected information that could trigger mean reversion. The competitive edge lies in proprietary in-depth research on historical price behavior and the pretrade planning process. Every trade follows a plan containing an in-depth scenario analysis and a pre-defined reaction function to unexpected or mean-reverting scenarios that could trigger mispricings</span>.‚Äù</p>
                <p>Well, yesterday, he live-streamed his full <span class="key">NFP preparation routine</span>, a key event for this strategy‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>What it included:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>&#x2705;Reviewing past NFP price reactions</li>
                    <li>&#x2705;Mapping potential momentum and mean reversion scenarios</li>
                    <li>&#x2705;Selecting the right currency pair for each idea</li>
                    <li>&#x2705;Allocating conviction levels</li>
                    <li>&#x2705;Researching expected volatility and outcomes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unlike typical live streams, you won't find him perched on a Lambo, or full porting some exotic before the number drops. üòÅ</p>
                <p>Just a methodical, clinical process: planning, prepping, and workshopping scenarios like a pro.</p>
                <p>A decent insight into the <span class="emp">real</span> work needed to carve out a long-term edge in this business.</p>

                <p>(Pleased to see they spent the budget on the weapon‚Ä¶ not the naming committee üòÜ)</p>
                <p>If you're curious, it's basically a massive portable microwave that fries drones mid-flight.</p>
                <p>Cos, we've all seen those drone swarms, right?</p>
                <p>Thousands of them flying in sync, lighting up the Beijing sky. Now imagine them armed with explosives instead of LEDs‚Ä¶ üò¨</p>
                <p>Anyway, I've veered off into armchair weapons expert territory. Let's get back to trading.</p>
                <p class="emp">What the hell does this have to do with trading, Mark?</p>

                <p>That's what good traders do.</p>
                <p>We might <span class="fsi">want</span> clean trend days‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>We might <span class="fsi">hope</span> for that nice 10 am reversal off VWAP‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>We might <span class="fsi">wish</span> crude oil to respect that tight channel we drew last night‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>But the market doesn't care what we want.</p>
                <p>Sometimes it's choppy.</p>
                <p>Sometimes it's slow.</p>
                <p>Sometimes it's irrational, overlapping, stop-hunting chaos.</p>
                <p>And the faster we accept that, the faster we stop trying to force our strategy onto a battlefield that's already changed.</p>
                <p class="emp">The best traders?</p>
                <p>They don't bring a knife to a gunfight. Or a breakout play to a mean-reverting mess.</p>
                <p>They stay alert to changing conditions, intraday or intra-quarter.</p>
                <p>They adapt.</p>
                <p>They deploy the right weapon at the right time‚Ä¶ or sit tight until the battlefield shifts.</p>
                <p class="emp">So here's a challenge this week:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üëä What setup are you forcing right now just because it worked last month?</li>
                    <li>üëä What market are you trading just because you're comfortable with it (even if it's sloppy)?</li>
                    <li>üëä And if your current edge isn't working, are you reviewing the conditions, not just the entries?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Worth a thought before the next drone swarm hits‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>Because sometimes it's just one small shift‚Ä¶ A minor calibration‚Ä¶ That gets you back on track.</p>

                    If you're newer to the game, one setup, one market is a great place to start. <br>
                    But if you're a little more experienced?<br>
                    It's probably time to build out a <span class="fsi">suite of strategies</span> you can deploy like tools in a belt.

                <p>See the pattern?</p>
                <p>The market didn't give a sh*t who hated it. It just kept going.</p>
                <p>And why do people hate rallies anyway?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It defies logic or fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Analysts can't reconcile it with PE ratios or recession fears</li>
                    <li>It feels like a bubble</li>
                    <li>Everyone's expecting a collapse</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="emp">But the main reason?</p>
                <p>When Wall Street hates a rally, it usually means they're lagging the benchmark‚Ä¶ and hating every damn minute of it!</p>
                <p>And that brings us to today:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üò°Another hated rally.</li>

                <p>So‚Ä¶ is this time different?</p>
                <p>
                    Maybe. <br>
                    Probably not.
                </p>
                <p class="emp">Does it matter?</p>
                <p>Nope.</p>
                <p class="key">If the market keeps climbing, as traders we keep buying dips, playing support, riding the wave.</p>
                <p>If it rolls over, great‚Ä¶ we all love a clean short!</p>
                <p>Either way, the lesson's the same:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üí° Sentiment drives moves.</li>
                    <li>And ‚Äúhated‚Äù doesn't mean ‚Äúover.‚Äù</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Because let's be honest‚Ä¶ <br>
                    <span class="emp">They have to buy it</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="key">Not because they love it, but because God forbid they miss the move while everyone else rides it higher.</p>
                <p class="key">Far better to be wrong with the herd than be the only genius who sat out and got fired for underperformance.</p>
                <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">Yeah, boss, I didn't buy the rally because I hated it</span>.‚Äù</p>

                    <p>Anyway, you didn't come here for market commentary on what happened yesterday‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Let's talk about something more important:</p>
                    <p>Theodore Roosevelt once said:</p>
                    <p class="emp">‚ÄúComparison is the thief of joy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p>And he was right.</p>
                    <p>When we compare our trading to others, we usually focus on what we lack, not what we've built:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>‚ÄúThis guy gets it better than me‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>

                        <li>‚ÄúThis guy journals better‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
                        <li>‚ÄúThis guy's trading account is way bigger‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You know the drill.</p>
                    <p>Especially if you're a driven man‚Ä¶ comparison is baked into your wiring.</p>
                    <p class="emp">But it's one of the biggest anchors to growth.</p>

                    <p>Here's why:</p>
                    <p>
                        üìâ <span class="emp">Comparison kills perspective</span><br>
                        You forget how far you've come, too busy watching someone else's highlight reel. (And yep, this is exactly why YouTube, etc can be so toxic if you're not careful.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        üß† <span class="emp">It rewires your motivation</span><br>
                        You start acting from insecurity and scarcity instead of vision and strength.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        üîÅ <span class="emp">It never ends</span><br>
                        Climb one peak and there's another. Bezos has the biggest yacht. But maybe he envies Elon's rocket‚Ä¶ or Zuck's‚Ä¶ non-surgically unenhanced wife. (Too much? Maybe. Still probably true.)
                    </p>
                    <p>So what do you do?</p>
                    <p>Simple shift:</p>
                    <p class="p-hlt">üëâ Replace <span class="emp">comparison</span> with <span class="emp">calibration</span></p>
                    <p>Instead of:</p>
                    <p class="p-hlt">‚ùå ‚Äú<span class="fsi">Why am I not where they are yet</span>?‚Äù</p>
                    <p>Try:</p>
                    <p class="p-hlt">‚úÖ ‚Äú<span class="emp">Am I on track with the trader I'm becoming</span>?‚Äù</p>
                    <p>It turns their progress into perspective, not pressure.</p>
                    <p>Your journey takes centre stage again.</p>
                    <p>That's the only race that matters.</p>

                    Nasdaq positioning is max long. When sentiment is stretched and price stalls‚Ä¶ red flag. Trapped traders and an already heavy boat.

                    Late May's pullback was about a 4% haircut. <br>

                <p>Fair play if he's nailed the top to the day. üéØ</p>

                <p>On Tuesday, I had a call with a trader who's deep into <span class="emp">Phase 2</span> of his strategy.</p>
                <p>The challenge?</p>
                <p>His single-instrument setup was working beautifully. Several strong months, solid size, consistent results.</p>
                <p>But, there were prolonged periods of no trades, and he wanted to <span class="emp">kick things up a gear</span>, without breaking what was already working.</p>
                <p>So, we jumped on a call and workshopped it through‚Ä¶</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>PHASE 2</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Jul/Phase 2.png" alt="Phase 2">
                </div>
                <p>After the standard British whinge about the heat, üòÅ we got down to brass tacks and laid out a few possible paths:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tweak the strategy to trigger more often</li>
                    <li>Add one or two new markets during the same execution window</li>
                    <li>Trade another market in a different time window</li>
                    <li>Increase size</li>
                </ol>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üö´ <span class="emp">More size?</span> Off the table (for now). He was already pushing enough; ¬£8k green days weren't uncommon, and the margin requirements meant he would have to deposit a big chunk of extra cash into his account.</li>
                    <li>üö´ <span class="emp">Adjusting the strategy for more frequency?</span> Hmm, I didn't like it. Could dilute the already working edge.</li>
                    <li>üö´ <span class="emp">Trading in a different time window?</span> Naa. He liked his current workflow and didn't want to mess with it. As tempting as it is to add more work, remember that focus and energy aren't infinite.</li>
                    <li>‚Äã‚úÖ <span class="emp">So we settled on adding new markets in the same window.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then he said something interesting:</p>
                <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">I only want to take shorts. I prefer shorting. I'm happy just waiting for the right setup</span>.‚Äù</p>
                <p>And I thought: perfect.</p>
                <p>That's what <span class="emp">Steenbarger</span> always says‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>‚Äú<span class="fsi">Elite performers don't just fix weaknesses‚Ä¶ they double down on strengths</span>.‚Äù</p>
                <p>
                    This trader was already good and had killer potential‚Ä¶<br>
                    If he wanted to laser focus on what he was good at, then great.
                </p>
                <p>So, we added two <span class="emp">uncorrelated markets</span> for <span class="emp">short-only entries</span>, and he left with a plan to run some low-R unit tests and build from there.</p>
                <p>Ok, why am I telling you this?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>When you hit a challenge, take the time to <span class="emp">map the options</span>. The obvious path isn't always the best one.</li>
                    <li><span class="emp">Play to your strengths.</span> If you're better at shorts, focus there. If you trade best in short bursts, design around that.</li>
                    <li>Then <span class="emp">craft a plan</span>, back it, and move.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>PS: Use TradingView? Right now, <span class="emp">Pepperstone</span> are offering <span class="emp">free subscriptions</span> for both <span class="emp">new</span> and <span class="emp">existing clients</span>. Worth a butchers. üëáüèº</p>

                <p>That's the trouble with textbook 'confirmation': wait too long and the moves over, or the RvR is so poor it's not worth taking.</p>
                <p>But dive in too soon and chances are you get stopped or take an unacceptable amount of heat.</p>

                    You've hit your daily loss limit or your target. <br>

                <p class="emp">Here's how it works:</p>

                    <li>Run it for one hour</li>
                    <li>Try to make as much as possible</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="emp">Why bother?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It keeps you off your live account when you know you shouldn't be trading</li>
                    <li>It trains your tape reading in a unique way‚Ä¶ You can't just ‚Äúexit.‚Äù You must commit or reverse. Tough.</li>
                    <li>It gives your ‚Äúchimp brain‚Äù something to chew on so you still feel productive (<span class="fsi">a common challenge for part-time traders‚Ä¶I'm at the screen, so I need to do something</span>)</li>
                </ul>

                    <span class="emp">The Terrain. Target. Trigger Framework</span><br>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Now I'm no neuroscientist‚Ä¶<br>
                    But I've been around long enough to know this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    That phrase builds the <span class="emp">illusion of certainty</span>. <br>
                    You think you saw it coming. <br>
                    You tell yourself you <span class="emp">knew it</span>. <br>
                    Then you beat yourself up for not acting on it.
                </p>
                <p>So, what happens next time?</p>
                <p>You get a hint of an idea‚Ä¶ and you're in‚Ä¶ cos there's no way you're going to miss <span class="emp">this</span> one, right?</p>
                <p>
                    Now, don't get me wrong, intuition is real. <br>
                    As a discretionary trader, it should be part of your edge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you never <span class="fsi">know it</span>. <br>
                    <span class="key">This is a game of <strong>probabilities</strong>, not <strong>certainties</strong>.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So instead of <br>
                    ‚Äú<span class="emp">I knew it</span> üò°‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try: <br>
                    ‚Äú<span class="emp">I saw that setting up‚Ä¶ what clues were there that I can use to support that setup next time</span>?‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>That shift‚Ä¶ from hindsight to process is how you turn ‚Äú<span class="fsi">I knew it</span>‚Äù from a dangerous phrase to a powerful trigger to <span class="emp">do the work</span>.</p>
                <p>Worth a try.</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="emp">PS: The Free TradingView deal is still live (at least it was last time I checked!)</span><br>
                    New <span class="fsi">and</span> existing Pepperstone clients can get their sub paid for, as long as you're a moderately active trader. <br>

                    So, most traders will switch off this August. <br>
                    Take a breather. Drift. Lose focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And hey, I'm all for holidays, downtime, recharging the batteries. <br>
                    We need that, right? üèñÔ∏è
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what if you carved out <span class="emp">just a little time this month‚Ä¶</span><br>
                    To reset. Refocus.
                </p>
                <p>Because great trading is about momentum:</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="emp">Build it ‚Üí stack confidence ‚Üí make better decisions ‚Üí trade better ‚Üí more confidence ‚Üí more momentum‚Ä¶</span><br>
                    And the flywheel starts spinning in your favour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, you could spend August coasting, like the crowd. <br>
                    Or spend a little of it hardening the mindset that sets you apart when it counts‚Ä¶

                    You always hear it: <br>
                    <span class="fsi">‚ÄúOh, August is a quiet month‚Ä¶‚Äù</span>

                <h3>AUGUST STATS</h3>

                </div>
                <p>I pulled the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) monthly stats, a solid enough benchmark for volume, range, and movement.</p>
                <p>Plugged it into my old pal ChatGPT. (So take everything with caution)</p>
                <p>Here's what came back:</p>
                <p>üìä <span class="emp">33-Year August Stats:</span></p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>‚úÖ <span class="emp">60%</span> of Augusts closed green</li>
                    <li>üöÄ <span class="emp">Best month:</span> +6.4%</li>
                    <li>üò¨ <span class="emp">Worst month:</span> -14.1%</li>
                    <li>üßÆ <span class="emp">Average return:</span> -0.27% (dragged down by a few wild ones)</li>
                    <li class="emp">üîä Volume: Above average</li>
                    <li>‚ö°Ô∏è <span class="emp">Volatility:</span> In line with most months</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then I asked for the past <span class="emp">10 years</span>, including <span class="emp">median range</span> to filter out the 2024 madness:</p>
                <p>üîé <span class="emp">Last 10 Years:</span></p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üìà <span class="emp">Avg return:</span> +0.85%</li>
                    <li>‚úÖ <span class="emp">7 out of 10</span> closed green</li>
                    <li>üì¶ <span class="emp">Median range:</span> 18 points</li>
                    <li>üì¶ <span class="emp">Average range:</span> 21 points</li>
                    <li>üìâ <span class="emp">Worst August:</span> -3.4%</li>
                    <li>üìä <span class="emp">Volume:</span> Still strong</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So yeah‚Ä¶ turns out <span class="fsi">‚Äúquiet August‚Äù</span> is more myth than reality. üò¨</p>
                <p>The pace might be what I call <span class="emp">staccato‚Ä¶</span> quiet lulls, then sharp bursts of volatility.</p>
                <p>But actually? The opportunities are still there.</p>
                <p>
                    Maybe it's the price action rhythm that changes. <br>
                    Or maybe I have been full of üí©, and August's no different than any other month‚Ä¶
                </p>

                <p>I often think of trading like a science experiment.</p>
                <p>
                    And I'm the, ahem, 'mad' scientist‚Ä¶<br>
                    Tinkering, testing, refining, always looking for edge.
                </p>
                <p>To keep it simple, I bucket my experiments into four categories‚Ä¶</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>TRADING SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Aug/Trading science experiments.png" alt="Trading science experiments">
                </div>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üß™ <span class="emp">Lose Less</span> ‚Äî Reduce losses, magnitude and frequency.</li>
                    <li>üß™ <span class="emp">Win More</span> ‚Äî Improve win rate on trades.</li>
                    <li>üß™ <span class="emp">Make More on Winners</span> ‚Äî Extract more from the winning trades.</li>
                    <li>üß™ <span class="emp">Find New Setups</span> ‚Äî Explore strategies worth adding to the playbook.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And so when I use buckets like this, I know exactly what the outcome should be.</p>
                <p>
                    So, let's say I'm in deep operational mode and looking at how the TICK index can help fine-tune a pullback entry. <br>
                    <span class="fsi">(I've done some good training on the TICK index here</span> ‚áí <a href="https://www.tradersmastermind.com/short-term-trading-strategies-using-the-tick-index/" target="_blank">Short Term Trading Strategies Using The TICK Index - A Day Trader's Quick Guide</a>
                </p>
                <p>That's a <span class="emp">Win More</span> experiment. I'm not trying to bank more on each trade, just hit a higher win rate by improving timing.</p>
                <p>Or maybe I'm reviewing stop losses in my journal‚Ä¶</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do I need the full stop here?</li>
                    <li>Should I be scaling out sooner on certain setups?</li>
                    <li>Are some plays producing too many full stops, and are they worth it?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That's squarely in the <span class="emp">Lose Less</span> bucket</p>
                <p>And that's the point:</p>
                <p class="emp">When you define the type of experiment, you stop obsessing over the P&L (which is often a lagging indicator)</p>
                <p class="key">And start measuring success by the outcome you intended.</p>
                <p>Try it.</p>
                <p>
                    Pick a bucket. <br>
                    Run the test. <br>
                    Review the result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You're not just a trader‚Ä¶<br>
                    You're the CEO of your trading business. <br>

                        <h4>#1 üß† Better ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù Mode</h4>
                        <p>Defaults to deeper reasoning more often. Which actually feels a bit sharper when tackling niche or complex trading questions.</p>

                        <p>
                            You can now link GPT-5 to Google Calendar + Gmail. (If you were so inclined‚Ä¶) Example: ‚ÄúList all market-moving events this week and flag if they clash with anything on my calendar.‚Äù<br>
                            <span class="fsi">(Maybe also: ‚ÄúSorry I forgot it was NFP Friday ‚Äî can you do my root canal the week after?‚Äù)</span>

                            Reads multi-indicator chart images far more accurately. Can handle multiple charts in one go and cross-reference with text prompts. <br>
                            I've tried this a few times and it is way better than before.

                    Not all sunshine though‚Ä¶ apparently some users hate GPT-5's blunter tone and want GPT-4 back. <br>

                <p>Are stops ruining your edge?</p>
                <p>Now that's an emotive question right‚Ä¶!?</p>
                <p>
                    Before you sharpen the pitchforks üòÄ, yes, of course I'm a fan of cutting losers. <br>
                    Risk management is non-negotiable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But trading is about thinking, testing, experimenting‚Ä¶ so let's poke the bear: <br>
                    maybe hard stops aren't all they're cracked up to be.

                <p><a href="https://x.com/millerdon?lang=en-GB" target="_blank">Don Miller</a> - one of the first trading bloggers who documented his $1.6m day trading run ‚Äî once said: (and I'm paraphrasing here)</p>
                <p class="fsi">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use stops. I manage risk with size.‚Äù</p>
                <p>Meaning he only used a hard stop as a last resort, sizing positions so he could manage exits manually.</p>
                <p>Larry Connors found that his mean reversion trades performed best with no stops at all.</p>
                <p>And random walk theory? It says the probability of your stop getting hit is twice the probability of price actually closing beyond it.</p>
                <p>
                    Translation: once you're stopped, the odds flip to 50/50 of it coming right back. <br>
                    <span class="fsi">(Not sure I fully buy that‚Ä¶ but you get the idea)</span>
                </p>
                <p>At some point, you need to exit a losing trade, that's a given, but exiting via a hard stop all the time, well, that might not be the best bet.</p>
                <p>So, what else can you do?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="emp">Manual Exit:</span> Watch the price action and close if the trade's no longer valid. (Disciplined? Great. Rule-breaker? Dangerous.)</li>
                    <li><span class="emp">Time-Based Stop:</span> Review at a fixed time ‚Äî hold, close, or adjust. Favoured by swing traders.</li>
                    <li><span class="emp">Hybrid:</span> Keep an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù hard stop but actively manage, trim, or exit before it's hit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I might have just opened a can of worms here‚Ä¶ but it's worth asking:</p>
                <p class="emp">Is slapping a hard market order stop on every trade actually helping your edge, or quietly killing it?</p>
                <p>Someone's got to ask the unpopular questions!</p>

                    Last month, the UK Supreme Court <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/traders-jailed-for-interest-rate-rigging-have-convictions-overturned-13400511" target="_blank">overturned his conviction</a>. <br>

                    Said the law wasn't clear. <br>
                    Said‚Ä¶ he should never have been convicted in the first place.

                    <img src="./assets/images/Aug/Day trading vs Swing trading.png" alt="Day trading vs Swing trading">
                </div>
                <p>The first thing to ask yourself is simple: <span class="emp">why</span> do you want to make the shift?</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üëâ Is it because your schedule has changed and you can't be glued to the screens all day?</li>
                    <li>üëâ Is it because the constant screentime focus of intraday trading is draining you?</li>
                    <li>üëâ Or is it because your results aren't where you want them to be, and you're hoping swing trading will ‚Äúfix‚Äù that?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That last one matters.</p>
                <p>Because if discipline and execution are the issue, changing the timeframe won't solve the root cause. <span class="fsi">(It just moves the same habits into a different tf.)</span></p>
                <p>Now, the trade-offs:</p>
                <h4>Pros of swing trading</h4>
                <ul class="cust">
                    <li>Calmer, less rushed decision-making. You've got time to plan rather than react.</li>
                    <li>Potentially better risk-to-reward ratios. You're no longer capped by the day's range.</li>
                    <li>More space to let themes and trends play out.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Cons of swing trading</h4>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>‚úò Overnight risk. Gaps can and will catch you out. (depending on the market)</li>
                    <li>‚úò Tape-reading edge doesn't translate well.</li>
                    <li>‚úò Far fewer trade reps. Instead of 5-10 trades a day, maybe you're getting a handful per month. That slows the learning curve.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So what's the play?</p>
                <p>If you're considering the switch, why not do both for a while?</p>
                <p>Keep a portion of your focus on intraday trades, but layer in swing positions on the side.</p>
                <p>That way, you'll see firsthand if the swing approach suits your temperament without throwing away the reps and data you're getting from day trading.</p>
                <p>
                    Because the real edge isn't in ‚Äúday vs swing.‚Äù<br>
                    <span class="key">It's in knowing which style fits your personality, goals, and life outside the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="emp">And maybe the answer isn't ‚Äúswitch.‚Äù</span><br>
                    <span class="key">Maybe it's ‚Äúdo both‚Äù... and lean into whichever gives you the edge right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="key">Market regime, goals, resources, skill set‚Ä¶ they all shift. Your job as a trader is to carve out edge.</p>
                <p><span class="key">And when you do have momentum? Push. Push hard. Momentum is the lifeblood of great trading. Don't pivot when things are working</span> üòé</p>
                <p>PS: Yep, still live‚Ä¶ <span class="emp">Pepperstone's footing your TradingView bill.</span> Trade often enough, and it just keeps rolling. T&Cs, naturally. üëáüèº</p>

                <p>Steven Perkins was an oil trader at PVM Oil Futures. In June 2009, after a boozy golf trip, he came home and decided to punt on Brent Crude futures.</p>
                <p>He traded roughly <span class="emp">7 million barrels of oil,</span> spiking Brent by over $1.50 a barrel. His last trade went through at 3:41 am.</p>

                <p>If you're not sure about a trade‚Ä¶ just leave it.</p>
                <p>We've all been there. Market's moving, volatility's high, but the setup isn't quite there.</p>
                <p>So we squint, tilt our heads, convince ourselves it's a trade, and hit buy/sell.</p>
                <p>Even if it wins, here's the problem:</p>
            </main>
            <main>
                <h3>CONVICTION</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Aug/Conviction.png" alt="Conviction">
                </div>
                <p>Without conviction, the trade is doomed.</p>
                <p>Think about it:</p>
                <h4>With Conviction</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're unfazed if it takes some heat. Stop is in, no worries.</li>
                    <li>If it pauses on the way to target? Normal ebb and flow. You hold.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>No Conviction</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It ticks against you: <span class="fsi">‚ÄúKnew I shouldn't have taken it‚Äù</span> ‚Üí cut early.</li>
                    <li>It stalls in profit: <span class="fsi">‚ÄúDon't want it to come back‚Äù</span> ‚Üí close early.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>See the difference?</p>
                <p>
                    The first is edge. <br>
                    The second is noise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One is repeatable. <br>
                    The other bleeds you out over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And yeah, we all take the odd sh!t trade‚Ä¶ human nature. <br>
                    But if you can pause and ask: <span class="fsi">‚ÄúReal trade or just a punt?‚Äù</span>
                </p>
                <p>‚Ä¶you'll stack far more conviction plays, and that, ladies and gents, is where the consistency lives.</p>

                <p>Not dabbling. Not tinkering. Not ‚Äútrying a bit of this, bit of that.‚Äù</p>
                <p>Pick one playbook. Immerse yourself. Block everything else out.</p>
                <p>Why 90 days?</p>

                <p>Others?</p>
                <p>They're the rare moves where adding is the only way to fully capture the opportunity.</p>

                <p>Common problem. It's the old trader saying amplified:</p>
                <p class="fsi">‚ÄúEat like a bird, sh*t like an elephant.‚Äù</p>
                <p>Make steady progress, then torch it with one or two bad trades/days.</p>
                <p>So, how do you fix it?</p>

                <h3>FIND YOUR DECISION POINT</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Aug/Decision point.png" alt="Decision point">
                </div>
                <p>The first step: figure out why.</p>
                <p>You're not blowing up because your strategy has a normal drawdown.</p>
                <p>You're blowing up because of <span class="emp">too much size, too many trades, and the desperation to ‚Äúget it back.‚Äù</span></p>
                <p>But here's the thing:</p>
                <p>There's always a <span class="emp">decision point.</span></p>
                <p>That moment on your equity curve where something flips in your brain.</p>
                <p>Where you stop trading like you did on the way up‚Ä¶ and start trading not to lose.</p>
                <p>Your job is to find it.</p>
                <p>Pull up the equity curves of every blown account.</p>
                <p>Spot the inflection point.</p>
                <p>Then go back through the blotter and look at the trades around it.</p>
                <p>Chances are, the catalysts are the same every time:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>üëâ A string of losers.</li>
                    <li>üëâ Forced trades in chop.</li>
                    <li>üëâ A tilt moment after missing a move.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But when you're in the heat of it, the emotion blinds you to the pattern.</p>
                <p>Identify the decision point ‚Üí and you've already won half the battle.</p>
                <p>Then you can actually build the fix‚Ä¶ and instead of blowing up, push the account back to highs‚Ä¶</p>

                    <h3>Dollar drop on politicized Fed may be part of Trump deal</h3>
                    <p>The world needs to brace itself. U.S. dollar losses on an unraveling of Federal Reserve independence may not simply be the fallout, it's likely the intention.</p>
                    <p>Donald Trump's daily bashing of the U.S. central bank this year has left little doubt that he intends to exert greater political influence over the Fed than any president since the 1970s.</p>
                    <p>His legally contentious move to fire Lisa Cook from the Fed board over allegations of mortgage fraud - based on loans taken out before she even joined the Fed - has been read by most people as a pretty clear attempt to create another vacancy on a seven-person board where members have long 14-year tenures.</p>
                    <p>If successful in dismissing Cook, Trump would secure a majority of apparent loyalists on the board next year - two are already in place, another position is in the process of being filled by his economics advisor Stephen Miran, and then there's the replacement for brow-beaten Chair Jerome Powell, whose seat is up for grabs in May.</p>
                    <p>Not only is Trump filling the board with like-thinking economists, but there are reports he is also seeking ways to shape the re-appointment of regional Fed bosses who make up the rest of the monetary policymaking council. These 12 Fed Presidents serve rolling five-year terms but all 12 come up for reappointment in February and the Fed board needs to approve them.</p>
                    <p>What does Trump want to do with the Fed? One of the president's publicly stated aims is getting interest rates down more than three percentage points to 1% - a move that would likely have a pretty dramatic downward impact on the dollar if even halfway successful.</p>
                    <p>But it's widely accepted the administration wants what it sees as a still over-valued dollar to depreciate further to help rein in U.S. deficits and reinvigorate U.S. industry - something Miran has written about extensively and Trump has publicly sympathized with.</p>
                    <p>It's likely a feature rather than a bug of its re-politicizing of the central bank.</p>

                    <p>XTX is a <span class="emp">quantitative trading firm</span>, like Citadel or Jane Street, making tiny slivers of profit across millions of trades.</p>
                    <p>On their site they put it like this:</p>
                    <p class="fsi">‚ÄúWe are a leading algorithmic trading firm that uses state-of-the-art machine learning technology to produce price forecasts for over 50,000 financial instruments across equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, and crypto."</p>

                    <p>And being the market nerd I am, I wanted to know:</p>
                    <p>What does an <span class="fsi">actual trade</span> look like?</p>
                    <p>(Because, spoiler alert: it ain't no bull flag on the 1-min Nasdaq üòé)</p>
                    <p>Turns out their signals are probably a lot about the <span class="emp">order book</span>:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>üìä Imbalances ‚Äî bids vs offers at each level</li>

                        <li>üî• Sweep patterns ‚Äî aggressive trades hitting multiple levels (aka momentum ignition I guess)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then add tick-by-tick patterns like:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>‚û° Micro-momentum (eg. 5 buy sweeps in a row)</li>
                        <li>‚û° Reversion signatures (‚Äúlast sweep was overdone, odds of bounce = x%‚Äù)</li>
                        <li>‚û° Intraday seasonality (NY open, close, liquidity pockets)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All of that goes into their <span class="emp">25,000 Nvidia AI chips</span>, chewed up in a data centre, and spat out as trades‚Ä¶ filled before you or I even open a ticket.</p>
                    <p>(Bet they made a killing over NVDA earnings yesterday!)</p>
                    <p>Anyway, it's not how we trade but I love anything like this‚Ä¶</p>

                </div>
                <p>In my latest podcast episode, I dig into alternative ways to think about stops.</p>
                <p>And yeah, I know I do bang on about this‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>But, I see it all the time: traders taking the standard advice, applying it to every setup‚Ä¶ and wondering why it fails.</p>
                <p>Sure, if a trade is invalid at a clean level, that's your stop. Easy. ‚úÖ</p>
                <p>But if your only reason for placing a stop is <span class="fsi">‚ÄúI just don't want to lose more‚Äù‚Ä¶</span> that might not be the best approach.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the smarter move is saying:</p>
                <p class="fsi">‚ÄúI'm willing to give this a bit more room, because the odds are in my favour.‚Äù</p>
                <p>That's the point.</p>
                <p>Stops aren't just damage control.</p>
                <p>They can be tools to frame risk differently‚Ä¶ and that shift can open up new ways to build edge.</p>

                    <p>From that standpoint, life for risk bulls is sweet and really since the April lows, risk markets have been exceptionally kind to those who stayed the course and <span class="key">added risk even on shallow pullbacks</span>.</p>

                <main>
                    <h3>Event Risks to Navigate in the Week Ahead</h3>
                    <p><span class="emp">US:</span> Labour market in focus with JOLTS (job openings, layoffs, quits rate), weekly jobless claims, and nonfarm payrolls (NFP). Also, ISM manufacturing and services surveys (both expected to improve). Fed speakers include Musalem, Williams, and Goolsbee ‚Äî the latter two speak after the payrolls report, so markets will be watching closely for any shifts in their guidance.</p>
                    <p><span class="emp">Outside the US:</span> Canadian employment data, EU & Swiss CPI, Australian Q2 GDP, and UK PMIs. The US NFP report on Friday is the pivotal release. At Jackson Hole, Jay Powell made clear his concern about a cooling labour market. If payrolls are the Fed's focus, options dealers should price higher implied volatility across S&P 500 and cross-asset options going into the event.</p>
                    <p><span class="emp">The markets current base case:</span> The median estimate from economists is +75k jobs, and the U/E rate eyed to tick up to 4.3%. If this outcome is realised, the Fed should cut 25bp in September ‚Äî an outcome already implied with 88% probability by interest rate swaps.</p>
                    <p><span class="emp">Stronger than expected:</span> >150k payrolls, U/E steady at 4.2%. Fed cut odds priced into swaps should fall to an implied 60-70%, USD rallies, gold trades lower, equities rally modestly as good data is good news for risk.</p>
                    <p><span class="emp">The sweet spot for risk:</span> 80k-120k payrolls, U/E at 4.2-4.3%. This would be cool enough to still justify an insurance rate cut in September, but not weak enough to stoke fears the Fed is behind the curve.</p>
                    <p><span class="emp">Weaker than expected:</span> less than 50k payrolls, downward revisions, U/E at 4.4%. Swaps may price some chance of a 50bp cut, but equity markets would likely treat this as ‚Äúbad news is bad news,‚Äù with labour concerns sparking broader risk-off moves.</p>

                    <p>I bet you do too.</p>
                    <p>Here's a quick test‚Ä¶</p>

                    <h3>WIN RATE</h3>

                    <p>Look at these two trading systems:</p>
                    <ul class="non">
                        <li>
                            üëâ <span class="emp bld">System One:</span>
                            <p>Makes ¬£100k per quarter.</p>
                            <p>Win rate = 5%.</p>
                            <p>That's 19 losers out of 20; strings of 50+ losses are common, but the few winners cover it all.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            üëâ <span class="emp bld">System Two:</span>
                            <p>Makes ¬£95k per quarter.</p>
                            <p>Win rate = 98%.</p>
                            <p>You win 49 out of 50 trades. Almost every trade is green.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="emp">Which one do you take?</p>
                    <p>Most traders pick System Two.</p>
                    <p>Even though it makes ¬£5k less.</p>
                    <p>Why? Because the ride feels smoother.</p>
                    <p>And that's the thing.</p>
                    <p>Losing streaks hurt. They chip away at confidence. You doubt the system. You meddle with size, stops, triggers.</p>
                    <p>You feel like you're doing the right thing, but often make it worse.</p>
                    <p>A lower win rate can be tough on the mind.</p>
                    <p>A high win rate? Dopamine on tap!</p>
                    <p>Smooth equity curve. Easy to keep going.</p>
                    <p class="emp">And real-world trading isn't always about the spreadsheet.</p>
                    <p>Someone who's never traded will never get why you'd ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to make less money.</p>
                    <p>But if it keeps you executing well? It's worth it.</p>
                    <p class="key">Optimal on paper doesn't always equal optimal in practice.</p>
                    <p>So before you say:</p>
                    <p class="fsi">‚ÄúI'll hold longer‚Ä¶ make more‚Ä¶ even if my win rate drops‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p>Remember, it's always a trade-off.</p>
                    <p>There's a middle ground.</p>
                    <p>Yes, P&L matters most‚Ä¶ but there's a point where the extra stress just isn't worth the extra cash.</p>

                <p class="emp">Should you tell people you are a trader?</p>
                <p>After 24 years in the game, my answer: it depends.</p>

                <h3>SOOOO‚Ä¶. WHAT DO YOU DO?</h3>
                <div class="img50">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Sep/Should you tell people you are a trader.jpg" alt="Should you tell people you are a trader">
                </div>
                <p>In some circles, you'd get a warmer reception admitting you're a bank robber‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>You're instantly the villain who ‚Äúcaused the financial crisis,‚Äù ‚Ä¶a heartless wan*ker in a Porsche, (aka Jerk for my non-Brit friends) ‚Ä¶plucking pennies from pensioners and laughing all the way to your offshore account.</p>
                <p>In other circles, though? You'll get a genuine chat about the economy, markets, and even someone telling you their uncle made a killing on Bitcoin. (Side note: did <span class="emp">every</span> uncle make a killing on Bitcoin? üòÅ)</p>
                <p>So, just like reading the chart‚Ä¶ you've got to read the room.</p>
                <p>If someone asks what you do, don't immediately hit them with ‚ÄúI'm a trader.‚Äù That's like going all-in on the first ignition candle.</p>
                <p>Instead, put out a little feeler position first: <span class="fsi">‚ÄúOh, I'm involved with the financial markets‚Ä¶ how about you?‚Äù</span></p>
                <p>Nine times out of ten, they'll just start waffling about their own job. Great. Bullet dodged.</p>
                <p>But if they probe further, that's when you've got to read the tape:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>
                        <p>If they hit you with: <span class="fsi">‚ÄúI tried Forex once‚Ä¶ it's rigged!‚Äù</span></p>
                        <p>‚Äãüö® Exit immediately. No liquidity there.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If they say: <span class="fsi">‚ÄúTrading? That's just gambling!‚Äù</span></p>
                        <p>üö® Fade the move, no edge in that conversation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If they smirk: <span class="fsi">‚ÄúWell, if you're so good, why aren't you richer than Jeff Bezos?‚Äù</span></p>
                        <p>‚Äãüö® Maximum stop-out. Abort.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Truth is, I don't love talking trading with non-traders anyway.</p>
                <p>We both know how hard it is to explain. I'd rather talk markets with a real trader like you than some stranger at a BBQ.</p>
                <p>But once in a while? You'll find someone who's genuinely curious. That's a high-quality setup.</p>
                <p>And here's the thing: if you're still a ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù trader, those moments often make you realise just how much you actually know‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>You've got more edge in your back pocket than you think.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Now, neither Reminiscences of a Stock Operator nor How to Trade in Stocks lays it out in clean, step-by-step detail.</p>
                <p>Partly because back then he couldn't exactly say: <span class="fsi">‚ÄúBuy when RSI crosses up through the Bollinger Band crush. Here's a chart‚Ä¶‚Äù</span></p>
                <p>And partly because I think his style evolved over time.</p>
                <p>Still‚Ä¶ if you piece it together, a pattern emerges.</p>
                <p>Let's see what we can find‚Ä¶</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>
                        <h4>üìç Trade Only at Pivotal Points</h4>
                        <p>He didn't guess bottoms or chase every breakout.</p>
                        <p>He waited for what he called a ‚Äúpivotal point‚Äù... that psychological moment where price had to show its hand.</p>
                        <p>Think a Wyckoff spring or a breakout that 'shouldn't' have happened‚Ä¶ but did.</p>
                        <p class="fsi">‚ÄúWhen a speculator can determine the Pivotal Point of a stock and interpret the action at that point, he may make a commitment with the positive assurance of being right from the start.‚Äù</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>ü•á Follow the Leaders</h4>
                        <p>Livermore didn't waste time scanning hundreds of charts.</p>
                        <p>He focused on the market leaders‚Ä¶ the strongest stocks in the strongest sectors.</p>
                        <p>Why? Because he thought they telegraphed what the whole market wants to do.</p>
                        <p class="fsi">‚ÄúConfine your studies of movements to the prominent stocks of the day.‚Äù</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>‚Äãüìà Ride It. Add to It. Sit on It.</h4>
                        <p>Once in, he'd let time do its thing, adding only when he was right.</p>
                        <p>Never averaging down.</p>
                        <p>Letting the big swing play out.</p>
                        <div class="fsi">
                            <p>‚ÄúThe big money is made in the big swing.‚Äù</p>
                            <p>‚ÄúIt was never my thinking that made the big money ‚Äî it was my sitting.‚Äù</p>
                            <p>‚ÄúI never average down. I add only when I'm right.‚Äù</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>‚õî Exit on Abnormal Behaviour</h4>
                        <p>Just as he waited for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù pivotal action to enter, it seems he watched for what he called ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù behaviour to exit.</p>
                        <p>Things like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Failed follow-through</li>
                            <li>Loss of momentum</li>
                            <li>Time decay</li>
                            <li>Price not acting in line with his thesis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When the rhythm of a strong move broke‚Ä¶he closed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>üß† Track, Reflect, Control</h4>
                        <p>Above all, he knew the battle wasn't just in the tape.</p>
                        <p>It was in himself, and he kept detailed trading journals.</p>
                        <div class="fsi">
                            <p>‚ÄúMy records began to talk to me.‚Äù</p>
                            <p>‚ÄúThe market didn't beat me. I beat myself.‚Äù</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, that's Jesse Livermore's trading strategy in a nutshell.</p>
                <p class="key">Not a rigid system. Not a holy grail.</p>
                <p class="key">A framework built on reading price at the right moments, riding leaders, and managing himself as much as the trade.</p>
                <p>PS: Fun fact‚Ä¶ Did you know Jesse Livermore's great-granddaughter was a p*rn star?!</p>
                <p>Yeah‚Ä¶ I'll let you search that one üëÄ</p>

                    <h3>'Fed put' works for stocks but not long bonds</h3>
                    <p>The epicenter of market anxiety right now is spiking long-term government borrowing rates, and rescuing that market will be far more complicated than steadying an equities wobble.</p>
                    <p>Tighter monetary and fiscal policy would typically be the solution to worries about aggravated inflation and mounting public debt, but that prescription can also depress growth and potentially exaggerate a tax revenue problem.</p>
                    <p>Deftness is required. What's not required is easy money.</p>
                    <p>For decades, equity investors have talked about the so-called central bank "put" - options market parlance for a policy safety net that limits sharp stock losses with restorative interest rate cuts and liquidity injections.</p>
                    <p>Popularized during the tenure of former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan in the 1990s, the "Fed put" essentially worked as advertised. Authorities could justify easing policy with the need to tamp down excess volatility and business uncertainty or the argument that the "negative wealth effect" could harm the wider economy.</p>
                    <p>Many economists and market observers worried back then that encouraging this belief would encourage undue risk-taking, which largely proved correct in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 banking crash and global recession.</p>
                    <p>But central banks' decade-long response to that credit shock took the form of balance sheet expansion and money printing, resuscitating the idea that a policy put existed.</p>
                    <p>Not only have these actions skewed markets by essentially making Wall Street equities "risk-free" over the past decade, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they have also allowed the U.S. government - like many of its peers - to stack up ever more debt, not least because the central bank has been hoovering up many of the bonds.</p>
                    <p>One glance at the performance of long-term government bonds this year - and particularly this week - suggests markets are calling time on that debt buildup.</p>
                    <div class="img80">
                        <img src="./assets/images/Sep/30-year government bond yields.png" alt="30-year government bond yields">
                    </div>
                    <p>If so, perhaps it's time to activate the central bank put to keep debt affordable and governments solvent?</p>
                    <p>Not so fast, and not so easy.</p>
                    <p>NO IFS OR PUTS</p>
                    <p>Rising debt is only part of the problem. If it was the only issue, then lower policy rates might well work to resolve debt sustainability math.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The real worry is that unlike during much of the past two decades, we may now be approaching a "crisis" the Fed can't easily resolve.</p>

                <p>So back in August 2000, top trader Linda Raschke did an interview with <span class="fsi">Active Trader Magazine</span>.</p>
                <p>(Don't bother Googling them.. the old URL now redirects to some dodgy casino site. I'll drop the proper PDF link below üëá)</p>
                <p>And unlike the <span class="fsi">‚ÄúI made bank from trendline breaks while sitting by the pool‚Äù</span> interviews we're bombarded with these days‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>üëâ This one was real insight.</p>
                <p>How a pro actually thinks. How she actually trades.</p>
                <p>And yeah, it was 25 years ago‚Ä¶ but as Jesse Livermore reminded us:</p>
                <p class="p-hlt fsi">‚ÄúThere is nothing new on Wall Street‚Ä¶ Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again. This is because human nature does not change.‚Äù</p>

                </div>
                <p>Across my career, the traders who stood out were always the specialists:</p>
                <ul class="non">
                    <li>
                        <h4>üëî Mr. UK Insurance</h4>
                        <p>Only traded insurance stocks on the LSE.</p>
                        <p>Knew them inside out.</p>
                        <p>I once saw him drop a 100k share order way down the book after the open, get filled as price drifted later that day, then watch it reverse like he'd scripted it... <span class="fsi">(Price was ¬£1.20, not ¬£120, before I get the emails! Big order, but not too big to leave on the book.)</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>üìä The FTSE/DAX Pair Guy</h4>
                        <p>That's all he did.</p>
                        <p>No spreadsheets, no models, just eyeballs on the spread between the FTSE and the DAX‚Ä¶ and he crushed it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>‚õèÔ∏è Mr. Gold Miners</h4>
                        <p>Wouldn't touch anything else.</p>
                        <p>Knew every company, every cycle, every nuance of sentiment.</p>
                        <p>Used price + deep sector knowledge to nail when the crowd had gone too far either way.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>üìà Mr. Economic Data</h4>
                        <p>You know him‚Ä¶ Aatu Kokkila (listen to my podcast with him here). <a href="https://www.tradersmastermind.com/a-32-million-fund-managers-insights/" target="_blank">Aatu Kokkila: A ‚Ç¨32 Million Fund Manager's Insights on Trading Forex Mispricings During Key News Events</a></p>
                        <p>Zero interest in scalping Nasdaq or punting meme stocks.</p>
                        <p>Just one thing: mis-prices and re-prices after economic data.</p>
                        <p>And his fund smashes it‚Ä¶</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="emp">Moral of the story?</p>
                <p>Specialise. Don't generalise.</p>
                <p>Even if you're trading the same markets as everyone else, get exceptional at one slice of it.</p>
                <p>There's more than enough edge there to build a monster‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>Hard not to pause and remember that we're all just passengers on this spinning rock together.</p>
                <p>The odds of us even existing‚Ä¶ here, now, at the same time are crazy small.</p>
                <p>Different paths. Different beliefs. Different fates.</p>

                <p>I recently picked up a 1924 copy of <span class="fsi">Studies in Tape Reading</span> by Richard D. Wyckoff.</p>
                <p>Beautiful condition, shipped from some guy in the US.</p>

                <p>Turns out, a lot of the legendary old-school traders were all saying the same thing:</p>

                    <li><span class="emp">Taylor:</span> <span class="fsi">‚ÄúThe trader should align with the day's intent, buy on Buy Days, sell on Sell Days. Don't fight the rhythm.‚Äù</span></li>
                    <li><span class="emp">Crabel:</span> <span class="fsi">‚ÄúFiltering for direction increases the odds of success. Most patterns work better when aligned with the dominant trend or bias.‚Äù</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Different eras. Different markets. Same lesson.</p>
                <p><span class="emp">Even if you think you're good enough to trade both directions at once‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶maybe you're better off sticking with just one.</span> ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
