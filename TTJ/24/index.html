                    <h3>Time in the market or timing the market?</h3>

                    <p>They say investing is about “time in the market, not timing the market”. Well for traders, one could argue this statement couldn't be further from the truth, where traders need to be selective with their time in the market, holding the patience to execute the higher probability set-ups and price action when it presents itself. Managing an open position is an art in itself - timing is critical, especially for those utilising leverage to take a position.</p>
                    <p>However, we also know that it's okay to be wrong in trading, but you need to know you're wrong and manage that loss unemotionally and quickly. Trading is about the probabilities seen in a market at that point, and assessing where the market has the greatest potential to move to, knowing that the market will go where it wants to go on any given timeframe, and flow and sentiment are the most influential short-term drivers.</p>
                    <p>FX markets have also seen a reversal of the flows we saw last week, with Latam FX finding solid buyers following the moves in US tech/semi and notably the CLP and MXN caught a solid bid. The net change in G10 FX has been subdued, although <strong>we are seeing better sellers in <span class="key">AUDUSD</span> and <span class="key">NZDUSD</span>, and that has been impacted by a weaker tape in <span class="key">copper</span> and <span class="key">iron ore</span> futures</strong>. Moves in US Treasuries have been contained, and this has lent to a small net change in gold and silver.</p>

                    <h4>A more explicit Fed more than meets the mark</h4>
                        <p>Another highlight was the further confirmation that the US labour market is of equal importance to inflation and that suggests some creeping concerns of future economic fragility that will need to be skilfully managed. Friday's nonfarm payrolls will therefore wear an increased risk premium for markets, and heightened volatility around the jobs print seems assured - <strong>if it's important to the Fed, it's important to market pricing</strong>.</p>
                        <p>In theory, it is now not out of the realm of possibility, if we do get higher unemployment in tomorrow's US payrolls, that US rates/swaps markets start to gradually price a premium for a 50bp cut in September, especially with increasingly concerning headlines from the Middle East.</p>

                    <p>The real test will be the outcome in next week's data releases, with US NFIB small business optimism survey, US CPI inflation, retail sales and University of Michigan sentiment survey all in play.

Conversely, poor numbers and anxiety levels could rise, and 'the market' could easily resume ramping up portfolio hedges and head back into recession trades.</p>

                    <p class="gld">Economic data, central bank meetings/speeches and company earnings guidance often result in short-term volatility, but the most important aspect is how the outcomes feed the evolving macro narrative.</p>

                    <h4>The event risks that could move markets this week</h4>
                        <p>With the <strong class="bld">overriding macro theme being the pricing the probability of a US recession over the coming 4 quarters, amid a synchronized global growth slowdown</strong>, one would argue that broad markets will be most sensitive to any data points that offer clarity around consumption trends, consumer spending patterns and inputs that feed into the <span class="key">GDP calculation</span>, with sensitivity also expressed on <strong>labour market data</strong>.</p>

                    <h4>A 25bp cut from the RBNZ is a coin toss</h4>
                        <p>By way of central banks, we see the RBNZ meeting on Wednesday, with NZ swaps pricing a 72% implied probability of a 25bp cut, while economists are split with 12/25 calling for rates to be left at 5.5% - this implies some degree of volatility in the NZD mid-week. We also see the rates decision from the Norges Bank (due Thursday at 18:00 AEST), although no one expects a change in rates here, it does pose some risk to those holding NOK (Norwegian krone) positions.</p>

                    <p>So, it's another big week ahead for traders - where, after a solid turnaround on Tuesday in risk assets (such as equity), we ask whether the upside momentum can build. The answers will likely come from the data flow, so stay nimble and react without hesitation.</p>

                    <p>If geopolitical angst is on the rise in crude and gold, then we saw no real interest to buy the CHF or JPY as a hedge in FX markets, and we see a mixed picture for the USD on the day. That may well change if EU and US Nat Gas were to start trending sharply higher, and crude pushed through the various <strong>key moving averages (50-, 100-, 200-MA's)</strong> - I guess in that dynamic we'd see far better buying of CHF as a hedge in the FX space.</p>

                    <p>Risk (growth equity, NZD, AUD, GBP) will find buyers if additional implied rate cuts are driven by a reduced inflation dynamic (i.e. right tail risk). However, the opposite is true if any additional rate cuts are driven by weaker growth or poor labour market readings - this week's US retail sales report could therefore be influential on that thesis.</p>
                    <p>My preference would be to leave <strong>limit orders</strong> to buy into 0.6040/35 - so if the RBNZ does cut, then we get a quick move lower as the 30% that isn't priced is realised. That said, the ongoing move in the <span class="key">NZD</span> will be down to their guidance and whether the tone meets the pricing for five 25bp rate cuts by Feb 2025. I see downside risk in <span class="key">AUDNZD</span>, but again I would be reacting to what was said, overplaying my hand over the meeting.</p>

                        <p>EURUSD is clearly driving the DXY move (the EUR holds a 57% weight in the DXY calculation), and with EURUSD pushing strongly higher, in line with S&P500 futures, we see EURUSD testing levels I had not expected to come into play so early in the week. I was looking at short positions in the pair into these levels, but after such impressive range expansion, I am standing aside on that trade.</p>
                        <p>USDJPY initially drove the USD selling in Asia yesterday, trading into 145.18 although we've seen shorts cover and we see rates at 146.60 - I suspect this pair will be at the heart of USD flows through Asia today, with USDCNH also one to that could influence the broad USD performance.</p>

                        <p>Gold has found support from the weaker USD and holds the former trend support for a new closing high. The broad market is long and strong, perhaps a touch too long, <strong>but until price can close below the 5-day EMA, I would either be long or neutral</strong>, but shorts have been frustrating and costly. There is always the risk we see USD shorts lighten up into Jay Powell's testimony on Friday but picking the low in the USD and top in gold has been costly, where the weight of capital flow has been one-way, and it still suggests that trend not for fighting just yet.</p>

                    <h4>The August US Nonfarm payrolls to settle the Fed rate cut debate</h4>
                        <p>It's hard to deny how important the August nonfarm payrolls (NFP) print (on 6 Sept) will likely be and could be the defining data point that settles the September FOMC rates debate, and whether the Fed cut by 25bp or 50bp.</p>
                        <p>Chair Powell essentially made it clear with his view that a “cooling labor market is unmistakable” and that they no longer “seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions”.  A weak NFP, say below 130k jobs and an unchanged unemployment rate at 4.3%, will likely see many of the economists who were calling for a 25bp cut for September change to 50bp, and US rates markets will price 50bp as its central case.</p>
                        <p>One counterargument to that call would be the influence of US election on 5 November. The Fed like to claim they are independent, but there is a school of thought that voters within the Fed ranks may be more comfortable pulling out a larger 50bp cut at the FOMC meeting after the election on 7 November. One issue with that call is that there is no guarantee we'll know the outcome of the election by then, so if there is a greater need to bring rates out of a restrictive setting, and the election result is not known, then the Fed will have to wait until the 18 December meeting - an outcome that the markets will see as a policy mistake and take the Fed to task.</p>

                            <p>In FX markets, pro-cyclical/growth currencies (AUD, ZAR, and NZD) were sold, while the JPY has shown its hand once again as the place to be at present. The sheer pace of the JPY rally since mid-July would be a growing concern for Japanese authorities, but it seems that there is further to go in the unwind of the JPY-funded carry trade and with Japan Q2 GDP (due today at 09:50 AEST) likely to be revised higher, this better growth may only increase the JPY inflows. We are seeing Japanese equity being carved up, and one questions if greater cracks emerge in the Japanese funding markets.</p>
                            <p><strong class="bld">The ECB Meeting</strong> (Thursday 22:15 AEST) - The ECB will almost certainly cut rates by 25bp, an outcome that is fully discounted. We also see expectations (priced into EU interest rate swaps) for a further 25bp cut by December, with the possibility of 2 25bp cuts. Therefore, the ECB's statement outlook and guidance on policy and new economic projections is where we are likely to promote a reaction in the EUR and EU equity indices.</p>

                        <p>Taking some of the gloss off broad sentiment was China equity once again failing to participate, with the CSI300 making yet another lower low. China gets close attention again in the session ahead, with the release of the August trade data, where we see loose expectations that exports will increase by 6.6% y/y and imports increasing modestly by 2.5% y/y. China's monthly trade data is a hard one to reconcile (and price risk off), not just because forecasting this data is a finger-in-the-air exercise, but there is also no set time for the release. However, given how sensitive markets are to China's growth trajectory at present, when we do know the outcome, it has the potential to impact commodity markets, as well as the <strong>China proxies</strong> (<span class="key">AUD</span>, <span class="key">NZD</span>, and <span class="key">copper</span> for example).</p>
                        <p>GBPUSD gets good attention from clients, and we see on the daily timeframe that spot has printed a lower low and has closed below the 3 Sept pivot. EURUSD sits on the 3 Sept low of 1.1026, where a closing break here and USD shorts would likely reduce more aggressively, with the prospect of 1.0950 coming into play. <span class="key">NZDUSD</span> <span class="emph">is starting to bear trend, with rallies into the <strong>5-day EMA used to add to shorts</strong></span> - one to watch.</p>

                        <p>With the market short of USDs, the rise in US bond yields triggered modest USD buying vs the GBP, EUR, and CHF, although USD repositioning has been most pronounced in USDJPY, with the spot rate trading above 142.</p>
                        <p>Asia has its chance to react to the rally in USDJPY, so we'll see if further squaring can lift the pair towards 143 - <span class="gld">it certainly seems prudent to <strong>reduce size positions</strong> and run <strong>very modest USD risk</strong> into the FOMC meeting</span> - as the potential outcomes for USD risk are truly dispersed and if you ask 10 people how they see the FOMC meeting going down, you'll likely get 10 different answers. We also see USDJPY closing above the 5-day EMA, which has defined the recent run lower from 2 September, so the downside momentum has clearly shifted.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>Learning a new strategy</p></li>

                                </ul>
                            <p class="emph">I'm not saying you'll never need to explore those areas, but sometimes the key to better trading is already within your current approach.</p>
                            <p>With just a few small tweaks, you could see noticeable improvements.</p>
                            <p>These Quick Wins are perfect for traders who:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>Have 12+ months of trading experience</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Have experienced some consistency but aren't quite where they want to be</p></li>

                        <p>So, everyone says trade without emotion.</p>
                        <p>Even the Trading Psychology OG Mark Douglas said; “<span class="gld">If you can learn to create a state of mind that is not affected by the market's behavior, the struggle will cease to exist</span>.”</p>
                        <p>But it's easier said than done right…</p>
                        <p>When you're in drawdown for the week and that last trade you took just stopped you out to the tick before ripping in your direction… it's pretty damn tough to stay calm!</p>
                        <p>The goal should never be to eliminate emotion, but rather to make sure your trades aren't influenced by emotion.</p>
                        <p>So here's a quick and simple way to reduce the emotional impact on your trades.</p>
                        <hr class="dash">

                            <h5>Time needed:</h5>
                                <p>1 minute (plus the time it takes to order from Amazon…)</p>
                            <h5>Action:</h5>
                                <p>When you feel that urge to trade, start a 60-second timer.</p>
                                <p>Huh? Yep, just start a 60-second timer and ask yourself:</p>
                                <p>“<span class="emph">Is this really the trade I want to take?</span>”</p>
                                <p>That 60 seconds is just enough to make you stop and consider what's <span class="emph">really</span> fuelling this trade decision.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Are you angry because you missed the rally?</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Frustrated because your equity curve has recently stagnated?</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Or is this a grade-A crisp and clean trade that fits your playbook perfectly?</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                <p class="emph">Trust me. Pausing to think for just 60 seconds is going to save you from a lot of poor trades…</p>
                                <p>And the very occasional trade you miss, because you waited an extra 60 seconds…well, it's worth it.</p>
                        <hr class="dash">

                        <h4 class="tac">How to do it:</h4>
                            <p>I recommend buying an actual timer rather than risking distractions from using your phone's stopwatch.</p>
                            <p>Here's the one I use:</p>

                            <div class="dac50">
                                <img src="./assets/images/Sep/timer.jpg" alt="timer">
                                <p>You can pre-set the 60 seconds on the screen and then when you are about to take a trade just hit the thing.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>It's a super easy habit to get into, and if you can do it before each trade you'll find it <strong>significantly reduces those impulsive trades</strong>.</p>

                            <p>But the problem is that we don't really KNOW for sure if holding winning trades will improve our trading…</p>
                            <p>I mean sure, we hear it all the time in trading quotes:</p>

                            <p>This will help.</p>

                            <h5>Action:</h5>
                                <p>Here's a simple tactic to help you understand the impact of holding your winning trades longer:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><span class="emph">Review Your Recent Trades</span>: Go back over a recent batch of trades. For each winning trade, note down what would have happened if you had held the trade for another 5, 15, and 60 minutes.</p>
                                            <p>No need for precision here - just eyeball the chart and jot down where the price was 5, 15, and 60 minutes after your exit. (Adjust these times if you're a hyper-scalper or a swing trader.)</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><p><span class="emph">Record Your Findings</span>: Enter the data into a spreadsheet to see what the outcome would have been holding for the extra period.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><span class="emph">Analyze the Results</span>: Instead of guessing where you “could” have exited using hindsight, this exercise gives you concrete data. You're asking yourself, “If I held a bit longer, how would that have impacted my bottom line?”</p></li>
                                    </ol>
                                <p>By reviewing this data, you will know exactly what the result of holding your trades would have been on your P&L.</p>
                                <p class="emph">And if you discover that holding all your trades for an extra 5 minutes pays off, then guess what?</p>
                                <p>Next time when you are about to exit your next trade, simply wait for another 5 minutes…</p>
                                <p>This simple adjustment can make a big difference:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p><span class="emph">Self-talk becomes easier</span>  : “Holding just a bit longer would have been the difference between red and green last week, so I'm holding this one.”</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                <p>Try it, and you'll find it's much easier to run the winners this way.</p>
                        <hr class="dash">

                        <p>PS: I appreciate that a blanket 5-minute hold for all trades might not be perfect in all market regimes… but these are quick wins. It's a good starting point to work from.</p>

                        <p>Alright so hopefully the discipline tracker has been useful for you.</p>
                        <p>But here's the reality - around this time, a lot of traders stop using it. Motivation wears off, you forget about it, and it ends up buried in your downloads folder.</p>
                        <p>And I totally get it.</p>
                        <p>It can feel tedious, logging and tracking…</p>
                        <p>So if you feel like you've dropped the ball a bit on your discipline, this email is perfect timing for you!</p>

                            <h5>Time needed:</h5>
                                <p>15 minutes</p>
                            <h5>Action:</h5>
                                <p>Take a look at all the rules you've set for yourself and <span class="emph">remove 80% of them</span>.</p>
                                <p>Wait, what?</p>
                                <p class="fsi">“I can't do that”</p>
                                <p>Actually, you can - and here's why.</p>
                                <p>You probably got into trading because you wanted freedom: no boss, no customers, just you and the markets.</p>
                                <p class="emph">You wanted to make your own decisions and be rewarded for them.</p>
                                <p>But now you've created a long list of rules you have to follow.</p>
                                <p>That's not exactly the free-spirited, swashbuckling market pirate you envisioned, right?</p>
                                <p class="gld">The truth is, too many rules can make us <strong>feel constrained</strong>, especially if you're a <strong>driven</strong>, <strong>self-motivated type</strong>. We end up <strong>rebelling against them</strong>.</p>
                            <hr class="dash">
                            
                                <p>So let's lighten the load:</p>
                                <p>Instead of a massive list of rules that tries to cover every possible trading scenario (and inevitably gets broken), prune it down to 3 or 4 essential rules:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><p><span class="emph">Your biggest risk management rules</span> (e.g., daily lockout, maximum loss per day).</p></li>
                                        <li><p><span class="emph">A rule that aligns with your current trading goal</span> (e.g., holding trades longer, avoiding counter-trend trades).</p></li>
                                        <li><p><span class="emph">An operational rule that always serves you</span> (e.g., not trading the first 5 minutes of the market open, sticking to specific markets).</p></li>
                                    </ol>
                                <p>Then, add <span class="emph">these</span> focused rules to your Discipline Tracker sheet.</p>
                                <p>Sure, your rules list won't look as long or comprehensive, but you'll have a much better chance of sticking to 3 rules than you do 23…</p>
                                <p>This way, you can go into each trading day totally focused on these key rules.</p>
                                <p>Once you get some momentum, you'll build confidence, and that confidence will make you feel more positive about your trading - it's a snowball effect.</p>
                                <p class="emph">Try it out: Simplify your rules and stick with them for a while. See how it goes.</p>
                                <p>My bet is you'll reignite that momentum and won't feel so shackled by too many rules.</p>

                    <p>We're always told to journal our trades right?</p>
                    <p>And it's sound advice.</p>

                    <p>If you're already journaling, this is a neat hack to get the most from your data.</p>
                    <p>But if you're not journaling, this is also a quick and simple way to get a big win from your trading history without logging every single detail… (Which is probably why you are not journaling right?!)</p>

                                    <p>Usually, there's a pattern or a set of conditions that led to these losing trades.</p>
                                    <p>Identify it and note it down.</p>

                                            <li><p>Were the trading conditions characterized by high volatility?</p></li>
                                            <li><p>Did these trades break out of a higher time frame pattern?</p></li>

                                    <p>Again, find the common thread and jot it down.</p>

                        <p>Fed chair Jerome Powell cooled speculation of a second 50-basis-point cut at the central bank's next meeting, indicating the central bank was in no rush and suggesting that two more quarter-point rate cuts by year's end was a base case.</p>
                        <p>"This is not a committee that feels like it is in a hurry to cut rates quickly," Powell told an event in Nashville, adding the economy was in "solid shape."</p>
                        <p>The comments reined in rate futures prices to show just 70bps of Fed cuts by the end of the year, down from more than 75bps earlier. Two-year Treasury yields briefly popped above 3.7% - although they retreated again early on Tuesday.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>So, have you ever found yourself constantly staring at an open trade … even though you know it's best to leave it alone?</p>
                    <p>You place the trade, and suddenly, your mind can't let go.</p>
                    <p>Watching every, single, tick…</p>
                    <p>Why is that?</p>
                    <p>Well, it's not just you… it's your brain's way of handling “unfinished business.”</p>
                    <p>There's a psychological concept behind this called the <span class="emph">Zeigarnik Effect.</span></p>
                    <p>It works like this:</p>
                    <p>When we leave something incomplete <span class="fsi">(like an open trade),</span> our brain keeps reminding us about it. It's like a mental loop that never shuts off until the task is done.</p>
                    <p>And in trading, this can be a huge problem…</p>

                        <h4>THE OPEN LOOP</h4>
                    </div>

                    <p>Now, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.</p>
                    <p>You've been there, right?</p>
                    <p>Placing a trade, then constantly checking the charts, wondering… <span class="fsi">“Did I make the right trade here?”</span></p>
                    <p>But here's the good news: there's a way to break this cycle.</p>
                    <p>And the solution could be simpler than you think…</p>

                        <h4>How to Stop the Mental Loop</h4>
                    </div>

                    <p>So, how do you stop obsessing over your open trades?</p>
                    <p>Here's the trick: you need to create your own closure. Even if the trade is still running, your mind needs a way to 'check the box' and move on.</p>
                    <p>Here's how:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <h5><li>Post-Trade Routine</h5>
                                <p>Write down all the reasons for the trade, set your stop and profit target. After that? You're done. Let it go. Your job is finished.</p></li>
                            <h5><li>Reframe Your Role</h5>
                                <p>Once you place the trade, the market takes over. You've already done the hard work. Now, let the trade play out without obsessing over every tick.</p></li>
                            <h5><li>Scheduled Reviews</h5>
                                <p>Set specific times to review your trades. Constantly refreshing your screen isn't helping… stick to a schedule and give your brain a break.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    
                    <p>So, next time you catch yourself checking your trades every five minutes, remember: you don't need to be glued to the screen.</p>
                    <p>Break the mental cycle, and your trading will be sharper, more focused, and a lot less stressful…</p>

                        <p>The market has seen yet another case study where growing concerns around a sustained deterioration in the US data flow have collided with a series of better key economic data points (JOLTS, ISM Services and NFP). The result has been market players having to rapidly rethink exposures - notably in US Treasuries where yields have teared higher on the week. In turn, <strong>the US economic exceptionalism trade has made a comeback</strong>, and tactical traders question whether this theme could last into the November US Election, especially if Trump's odds were to improve.</p>

                        <div class="dac75">
                            <img src="./assets/images/Oct/Citigroup economic surprise index.png" alt="Citigroup economic surprise index.png">
                            <p>The Citigroup US economic surprise index has risen to the best levels since April (see chart above), highlighting the trend of US data releases beating economists' consensus expectations. We can also see the US economic surprise index having the strongest positive trend relative to other major nations' economic surprise indices, and while not yet at levels which really cement a consensus US exceptionalism/long USD position trade, it is certainly adding to the current upside momentum.</p>

                        <p>Staying on the central bank theme, Wednesday's RBNZ meeting may not get the same level of market attention as the Fed, ECB, or BoE meetings, but with high expectations for an outsized 50bp cut to the cash rate, increased attention on the NZD seems likely. <strong>Long <span class="key">AUDNZD</span> has been a big consensus trade</strong> with the spot rate rising to 1.1000, and until we see a daily close below the 5-day EMA the trend higher looks robust.</p>

                <div class="para">
                    <p>So, have you ever heard of David Tepper?</p>
                    <p>If not, let me fill you in with a few quick facts…</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><span class="emph">Appaloosa Management Founder</span>: Tepper founded his hedge fund in 1993, making his fortune by betting on distressed assets.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="emph">Contrarian Investor</span>: Known for bold trades, Tepper profited heavily during the 2008 financial crisis by investing in beaten-down bank stocks.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="emph">Billionaire Status</span>: With a net worth of over $18 billion, Tepper is one of the most successful hedge fund managers in history.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="emph">Market Timing Master</span>: Tepper's ability to identify opportunities in volatile markets has earned him consistent high returns and a reputation as a top investor.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>So, he's a big deal.</p>
                    <p>Recently, Tepper did an interview on CNBC where he discussed his latest China trade.</p>
                    <p>And while the “China play” is interesting, what really stood out was how he thinks and positions his trades.</p>

                    <p>You might be thinking <span class="fsi">“Who cares? I'm not an investor.”</span></p>
                    <p>Fair point, but understanding how big money thinks gives us, as short-term traders, a clearer picture of market movements.</p>

                <div class="para">
                    <p>Here are a few standout moments from the interview:</p>
                    <p class="fsi">“I went over that limit on the Fed.”</p>
                    <p>Tepper waited for the Fed's signals before placing his trade, wanting a clearer picture before committing.</p>
                    <p>On position size and risk:</p>
                    <p class="fsi">“The Value at Risk model is what lets me sleep at night.”</p>
                    <p>Funny!</p>
                    <p>On increasing his position:</p>
                    <p class="fsi">“Last night, I did more.”</p>
                    <p>He added to his position after a key statement from the Chinese government.</p>
                    <p>Then he said this:</p>
                    <p class="fsi">“I would have another new found limit on a pullback”</p>
                    <p>This is exactly why buying pullbacks works right? Because big money is waiting to do the same.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I thought it was a great clip.</p>
                    <p>But more importantly, hearing how a hedge fund titan positions himself around major catalysts gives us a deeper insight into why markets move the way they do.</p>

                        <h3>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF BIG WINS</h3>
                        <img src="./assets/images/Oct/The psychology of big wins.jpg" alt="The psychology of big wins.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="para">
                        <p>This is why a favorable risk-reward ratio is a game changer for your mindset.</p>
                        <p>With a strategy like Trader 2's, you're always one or two trades away from reversing your drawdown.</p>
                        <p>Instead of trying to claw your way back with multiple wins, you're mentally prepared for the turnaround to happen faster.</p>
                        <p>It's easier to stomach losses, stick with your plan, and most importantly, keep your confidence intact.</p>

                        <h4>Why It Works:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Fewer Wins, Same Results</span>: Even with a lower win rate, your winning trades more than cover the losses when your risk-reward ratio is higher.</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Confidence Through Drawdowns</span>: Drawdowns are inevitable, but knowing that one trade can get you back to break-even (or better) helps you stay focused and avoid second-guessing yourself.</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Less Pressure to Be “Perfect”</span>: With a 1:1 ratio, you need to be right a lot, and that kind of pressure leads to stress, overtrading, and mistakes. With a higher ratio, you've got more room for error, and less scrambling for perfect execution every time.</p></li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>Is It for everyone?</p>
                        <p>No, it's not.</p>
                        <p>But if you're struggling with drawdowns, tweaking your strategy for a higher risk-reward ratio could change the game.</p>
                        <p>Not only will it improve your equity curve, but it'll also help you maintain the mental clarity and confidence that are crucial for long-term success.</p>

                        <p>There's actually a reason for that, it's called the <span class="emph">“Lunch Effect”</span>.</p>
                        <p>And I found a white paper researching that whole phenomenon.</p>

                        <p>Between <span class="emph">12 PM and 2 PM</span>, U.S. stock markets tend to drift upward.</p>
                        <p>Why?</p>
                        <p>Well, most human traders are away from their screens, probably grabbing lunch and maybe a swift half… so with fewer active decisions being made, the algos take over, and the market tends to smooth out, often creeping higher.</p>
                        <p>But here's the interesting bit: <span class="emph">before lunch</span>, there's usually a slight pullback.</p>
                        <p>Between <span class="emph">11 AM and 12 PM</span>, the market tends to dip before starting its upward move.</p>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>A study from Quantpedia dug into the numbers, analyzing <span class="emph">SPY data from 2010 to 2024</span>, and what they found is pretty interesting.</p>
                        <p>While the market's <span class="emph">Overnight Effect</span> has faded a bit, the <span class="emph">Lunch Effect</span> is still going strong.</p>
                        <p>That subtle dip between 11 AM and 12 PM is followed by a small rise until around 2 PM.</p>
                        <p>For day traders, these small edges can really add up.</p>

                        <h4>How to potentially trade it.</h4>
                            <p>So, could you take advantage of this?</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Short from 11 AM to 12 PM</span>: Look for the pullback during this window.</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Go long from 12 PM to 2 PM</span>: Once the dip ends, potentially get long and ride that midday drift upwards.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It's simple but effective.</p>
                            <p>Just remember though, this is supposedly a theme over 14 years…</p>
                            <p>So, put it into perspective. This isn't going to be a dead cert every day.</p>
                            <p>It's just a theme that's maybe worth keeping in mind…</p>
                            <p>Every edge counts, right?!</p>

                        <p>You get the idea.</p>
                        <p>Some common strategic pivots:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>Day to swing - Reduce the decision-making pressure</p></li>
                                <li><p>Swing to day - Increase the number of trading reps</p></li>
                                <li><p>Moving markets - Trading where the opportunity is</p></li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>Or it could be something more subtle…</p>
                        <p>Shiny object syndrome is one thing, a strategic pivot is another.</p>

                        <p>Ever wonder how to align multiple timeframes for the perfect entry?</p>
                        <p>David, a trader who reads these emails, asked me this very question…</p>
                        <p class="fsi">“Mark, I still don't get how you combine the 15, 5, and 1 minute to get an entry… can you explain with some examples?”</p>
                        <p>Great question, so let's break it down…</p>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>The idea of using the higher timeframe is all about getting context, right?</p>
                        <p>If you're trading a choppy directionless market like Lumber above, what are the chances of being chopped around intraday?</p>
                        <p>Very high.</p>
                        <p><strong>But if you're trading something with a bit of action, then you can align with that sentiment and use it to your advantage on the lower time frames</strong>.</p>
                        <p>So, in David's question above, how do we combine the 15m with the 5m to get an entry?</p>
                        <p>Well, firstly, you don't <span class="emph">need</span> to go down the timeframes.</p>
                        <p><strong>If you see something on the higher timeframe then by all means stay there and do everything on that chart</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>But when you want to fine-tune an entry, dropping to a lower timeframe can be beneficial.</strong></p>
                        <p>Let's look at a classic flag example.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>I'm using the China 50 as a really nice example - I get that it might not be the most popular trading vehicle, but the patterns have been pretty clean lately.</p>
                        <p>Ok, so the market gaps up, it has a bit of a think before clicking into gear and driving hard to the upside.</p>
                        <p>It then forms a consolidation right at highs.</p>
                        <p>Classic bull flag pattern I think you'll agree.</p>
                        <p>Pole + Flag</p>
                        <p>Any momentum trader will want to get long here, so what are the options?</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Buy a break of the flag highs</p></li>
                                <li><p>Buy a dip under flag lows</p></li>
                                <li><p>Front run a break using the lower timeframe for guidance</p></li>

                            <p>Assume you want to get long, and so drop down to a 1-minute chart to fine-tune the entry.</p>
                            <p>You already know the setup, a bull flag, but the 1-minute gives you more detail.</p>
                            <p>And this is what it looks like:</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>It looks like a range, right?</p>
                        <p>Of course! That's the flag section, and why it's so important to look at higher TF context.</p>
                        <p>So from a technical perspective, you now have a few more options:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>Buy a bullish ignition candle AFTER the failed break to the downside (like a range break fake play)</p></li>
                                <li><p>Buy a breakout of the short-term swing high</p></li>

                            <p>Well, traders who throw in, say a grand are usually looking to double, triple, or quadruple their account as fast as possible.</p>
                            <p>They see an ad, open an account, throw some cash in, and quite literally punt away until it's gone…</p>
                            <p>Now, of course, there's no problem with trading small to begin with, in fact, it should be <span class="emph">encouraged</span>.</p>
                            <p>But you should treat your £1k like it's £100k.</p>
                            <p class="gld">Small risk per trade, get experience, and refine your strategy.</p>
                            <p class="emph">The objective is not to make meaningful money in the beginning… it's to get your process dialled in.</p>
                            <p>Then, at the end of the year, if you're up say £900 with a limited drawdown and a steady equity curve, then you might consider adding more funds.</p>
                            <p>But of course, your average new trader is not interested in that! Too boring…</p>
                            <p>They want to turn that £1k into £10k quickly, and to do that they need to take big risk.</p>
                            <p class="emph">Big risk + inexperience = high probability of blow up.</p>

                        <p>Ok, so if you're reading this, I already know you're not the get-rich-quick gambler type…</p>
                        <p>Regardless of whether you are trading with £1,000 or £1,000,000</p>
                        <p class="emph">If you're taking the time to improve your trading craft, you're already in the top 50% of traders.</p>
                        <p>Most can't be bothered…</p>
                        <p>So, that <span class="fsi">“75% of traders lose”</span> stat has to include everyone, gamblers and all, making the number look worse than it really is.</p>
                        <p>Alright, and then we come to experience.</p>
                        <p class="emph">Experience is proportional to profitability.</p>
                        <p>Not always of course, but in general terms, the longer you've been at this game the more likely you are to be profitable.</p>
                        <p>Even if you're a slow learner, sticking your hand in the fire time after time you start to realise not to do that…</p>
                        <p>Most traders are out of the game within a year.</p>
                        <p>So if you can stick it out more than that, you're already above average.</p>
                        <p class="emph">Two Markers of Success</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Good risk control</span> and a <span class="emph">sensible approach</span> to account growth</p></li>

                            </ol>
                        <p>If we strip out the gamblers and the inexperienced traders from that stat, the numbers start to look a lot more encouraging.</p>
                        <p>Sure - the game is not easy.</p>
                        <p>But sometimes I look at those stats and I think how demoralising they must be for traders…</p>
                        <p>And whilst they might be <span class="emph">technically accurate</span>, once you dig into the details, they're not quite as bad as they seem.</p>

                        <p>Here's how:</p>
                        <p><span class="emph">Start small</span>: Focus on one aspect of the habit. For example, if you tend to overtrade, start by reducing the number of trades you allow yourself to take each day. Work towards that 'perfect' number.</p>
                        <p><span class="emph">Set clear rules</span>: If your bad habit is cutting winners too early, set a specific rule for when you'll let a trade run (e.g., only close above a certain target or stop). Stick to it no matter what.</p>
                        <p><span class="emph">Track your progress</span>: Each day, review how well you stuck to your plan. Did you improve? What triggered you to break the rule? Reflect and make adjustments.</p>
                        <p><span class="emph">Get accountability</span>: Tell someone you trust about your bad habit and your plan to tackle it. Sometimes having someone else to check in with can make a huge difference.</p>
                        <p><span class="emph">Celebrate small wins</span>: Every time you make progress, no matter how small, acknowledge it. Building positive momentum is key.</p>
                        <p class="gld">Remember, tackling a bad habit is about consistency.</p>
                        <p><span class="gld">Small changes add up over time</span>, and before you know it, that bad habit will be a thing of the past.</p>

                        <p class="emph">The 'best' pattern depends on your objective right?</p>
                        <p>(Saying that though, I do think some patterns have stood the test of time and 'make sense' on most timeframes.)</p>

                        <p>Jason Shapiro was featured in Jack Schwager's newest book Unknown Market Wizards.</p>
                        <p>Known as the <span class="emph">contrarian trader</span>, Shapiro looks for a mixture of technical and fundamental clues to time his trades</p>
                        <p>Here's how he does it…</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>Shapiro's general rule is to fade 'crowded markets.'</p>
                        <p>However, we all know that markets can stay crowded for a long time before they eventually turn.</p>
                        <p>As they say, <span class="fsi">“The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”</span></p>
                        <p>So, Shapiro combines a crowded market with a reversal trigger.</p>
                        <p>Here's his thought process:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Why are people buying or selling?</span> (What's the story or market engine?)</p></li>
                                <li><p class="emph">Why are traders positioned the way they are?</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Wait for news to confirm the thesis.</span> (For example, if the market is well-bid, the news needs to be bullish to confirm the reason for being long.)</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Look for the price to respond in the opposite direction.</span> (If bullish news or data comes out, but the market moves lower.)</p></li>
                                <li><p class="emph">Enter the trade.</p></li>
                            </ol>

                        <h4 class="tac">Formula for a Reversal Opportunity:</h4>
                            <p>A crowded market driven by a theme + More news to support that theme + Unexpected price response = Reversal opportunity</p>

                        <p>I'm going to take some time to look at trade ideas, potential movers, setups etc.</p>
                        <p>But before we go there, let's get prepared.</p>
                        <p>As Abraham Lincoln said - <span class="emph">“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.”</p></span>
                        <p>We need to sharpen our axe…</p>
                        <p>In other words, <strong>take some time to plan as much as possible</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Make no mistake, <strong>the election is going to offer some incredible trading opportunities</strong>, but we can't just expect to turn up and make profitable trades.</p>
                        <p>To give ourselves the best possible chance of success <strong>we need to be prepared</strong>.</p>
                        <p>So, let's look at the key points together…</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>No one knows the outcome, but one thing is for certain - <strong>volatility</strong>.</p>
                        <p>And we all know that means <strong>increased risk</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Not just from the <span class="emph">wider spreads</span> and <span class="emph">lower liquidity</span></strong>. (Yes, even you EURUSD traders are going to see wider spreads when the swing state results start coming through.)</p>
                        <p>You should decide on a few key points:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>Do you want to trade the election night? Or just watch?</p></li>
                                <li><p>Are you going to restrict yourself to certain trades and plays?</p></li>
                                <li><p>Are you going to let the dust settle first and then scan for trade?</p></li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>In other words, are you even opening the door to election trading?</p>
                        <p>For some that answer's a “no” - they prefer to let the noise calm down and then trade as usual.</p>
                        <p>For others, the answer is a “hell yeah!” - they want to get stuck in and attempt to capture some of the <strong>expected wild swings</strong>.</p>
                        <p>There's no right or wrong here… <span class="emph">but commit to one</span>.</p>
                        <p class="key">The last thing you want to be doing is telling yourself you won't trade the results flow and then get sucked into something you hadn't planned to take.</p>
                        <p>Once you've made your decision, the next question to ask <span class="fsi gld">“How much am I prepared to risk?”</span></p>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>No one can answer this for you.</p>
                        <p>And before you decide… consider your strengths and weaknesses as a trader.</p>
                        <p><span class="key">If you're susceptible to rule-breaking and discipline issues, just know that volatile markets fuelled by news are going to amplify those issues…</span> do you really want to put yourself in a vulnerable position?</p>
                        <p>Better to wait it out, and act calmly in the days and weeks after.</p>
                        <p>There will be a load of opportunities.</p>
                        <p>But, perhaps one of your strengths is spotting short-term sentiment shifts quickly, maybe you are excellent @ squeezing the most juice out of those intraday swings.</p>
                        <p>In which case the 5th is going to be an opportunity that plays to your strengths.</p>
                        <p>Don't be a hero here, look at it objectively.</p>
                        <p>At the end of November, your bank manager doesn't ask if you made that money on election night!</p>
                        <p class="gld">A good month is a good month, whether that's <strong>election night scalping</strong> or <strong>one nice runner in the following week</strong>.</p>
                        <p>So, <strong>decide on your risk capital allowance</strong>. <span class="key">What's your <strong>total election loss limit</strong>?</span></p>
                        <p>That might be different to how you usually do it, but <span class="key">I find that having a <strong>loss limit</strong> set that covers all election trades <strong>allows for slippage, sizing adjustments and a bit more flexibility</strong></span>.</p>
                        <p class="key">It also puts your <strong>mind at peace…</strong> you set a number you are <strong>'comfortable' with losing</strong>. As long as you stick to that <strong>loss limit</strong>, you are good.</p>
                        <p class="fsi">(This is all very personal, <strong>you decide how you allocate <span class="key">risk capital</span></strong>, but it's an approach I like.)</p>
                        <p>Ok, now the <strong>risk decision</strong> has been made, let's start <strong>planning…</strong></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="tmm">

                        <p>This is probably not something you would normally consider, but as someone who has traded through multiple elections, trust me, it's worth boxing off.</p>
                        <p>Results are expected to be released throughout the evening and night (depending on your time zone). This means if you plan to trade, you may well be trading tired…</p>
                        <p>Most of us can do it for one night, but a bit of planning can help make life easier.</p>
                        <p>What you don't want is to be up all night waiting for some news, only to be super fatigued the next day when the real moves are happening.</p>
                        <p>So here's a suggestion. <span class="fsi">(And I appreciate not everyone trades full time, so adjust to suit.)</span></p>
                        <p>Make a <span class="key">decision</span> to <strong>either stay up and trade</strong> OR <strong>sleep and attack the next day</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Now, it's not always easy to know beforehand which is best right?</p>
                        <p>It's going to depend on many factors, <strong>are results close</strong>, <span class="key">are we seeing some <strong>swing states</strong> with <strong>early announcements</strong>?</span></p>
                        <p>Whilst it might be tempting to stay up all night watching the markets, just know you won't be on form and ready for the bell the next day.</p>
                        <p>So at some point, you might make the decision to call it a night and be fresh for the next day…</p>
                        <p>Or, you may decide there's a plentiful opportunity and you are going to stay at the station.</p>
                        <p>Up to you.</p>
                        <p>Oh, and one more thing…</p>
                        <p class="gld">If you feel like you have a great trade, <strong>the stop is in place</strong> and this thing could run. Going to bed might be the best thing for it…</p>

                    <div class="para fsi">
                        <p>“Trump is good for stocks - stocks will rally”</p>

                        <p>But in my two decades playing this game, I know the expected response doesn't always play out…</p>
                        <p>Often it does, and if so, great.</p>
                        <p>But <strong>many times</strong> the opposite will happen and then <span class="key">the <strong>news outlets</strong> will <strong>flip</strong> the <strong>narrative</strong> and give a reason why</span>.</p>
                        <p>Usually with the word “Despite” - <span class="fsi">“Despite the expectation of corporation tax cuts, stocks fell sharply on &#10092;insert potential reason&#10093;”</span></p>
                        <p>So, just know, that we can prepare a <strong>game plan</strong>, and our <strong>thesis</strong> can be solid.</p>

                            </ul>
                        <p>All based on <strong>logic</strong>.</p>
                        <p class="key">But we don't <span class="emph">really</span> know how markets will react, <strong>it's not always as simple as bullish or bearish</strong>.</p>
                        <p>There's more <strong>nuance</strong>.</p>
                        <p class="gld">And sometimes the <strong>unexpected price response</strong> can actually be the best trade going.</p>
                        <p><strong>People scratching their heads</strong>, <span class="fsi key">“Logically this shouldn't be happening, I don't get it…”</span></p>
                        <p>So remember this</p>
                        
                        <h4>“PRICE RULES ALL”</h4>
                            <p>No matter what the experts think, or what we think, <strong>the only thing that matters is what price does</strong>.</p>
                            <p class="gld"><strong>Don't fight it</strong>, <strong>don't try and outsmart it</strong>, take the <strong>expectations</strong> combined with the <strong>price response</strong> and see the <strong>real story</strong>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Over the next few days, I'm going to <strong>share ideas</strong>, <strong>potential movers</strong>, and <strong>possible game plans</strong>.</p>
                        <p class="gld">But on the day I'll be guided by price response.</p>
                        <p>Yes, the planning is going to help massively because maybe the 'obvious' trade is the best.</p>
                        <p>There's nothing wrong with <strong>spotting momentum</strong>, <strong>timing your entry</strong>, and <strong>taking a piece of the move</strong>.</p>
                        <p>But should the price not do what everyone expects, I'm going to <strong>reassess</strong>, take in the <strong>new information</strong> <span class="key">(price response)</span>, and <strong>position accordingly</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Alright, that's enough for one day!</p>

                        <p>One way of getting a feel for price action during elections is to review prior elections and observe any similarities.</p>
                        <p>Now of course, no two elections are the same. Each has its own backdrop, candidates, policies, and other factors that shape how the market responds.</p>
                        <p>But I think it makes sense to study recent years and look for some common themes.</p>
                        <p>So, I went back to 2008 and pulled up the intraday 15m charts of the S&P 500 futures, plus the broader economic context.</p>

                        <h4>Market Action:</h4>
                            <p>Volatile pre-election, then a rally post-election as Biden's win became clear. Markets cheered the idea of a divided Congress, limiting major policy changes like tax hikes. The NASDAQ outperformed, tech being a safe haven. Volatility dropped as election uncertainty cleared.</p>

                        <h4>Market Action:</h4>
                            <p>Futures plunged overnight as Trump's victory became clear, but the market rebounded sharply the next day. Why? Traders saw opportunities in deregulation, tax cuts, and infrastructure spending. The “Trump rally” was fueled by pro-business sentiment.</p>

                            <p>Obama re-elected. Stocks dropped sharply post-election due to fears of higher taxes and regulatory pressure, especially on energy and financials. Markets recovered later, buoyed by Fed policies and avoidance of the fiscal cliff.</p>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>One striking similarity stood out: in all years except 2008, price initially faked out in one direction before reversing.</p>
                        <p>This knee-jerk reaction often flipped several hours later, as narratives shifted and traders scrambled to adjust.</p>
                        <p><span class="emph">Timing:</span> The initial move tends to start between <span class="emph">7 pm and 9 pm EST</span>.</p>
                        <p>This is something to consider as part of your <strong>game plan</strong>: <strong>the <span class="key">first move</span> is often not the <span class="key">“real” move</span></strong>.</p>
                        <p>Of course, it'll depend on the results and information flow, but if history is any indication, a <strong>head fake</strong> is worth watching for.</p>
                        <p>Even if you don't trade the S&P 500, this pattern has shown up in other markets as well (sometimes inversely).</p>
                        <p>Here's the Dollar Index from 2020, starting its own first head fake at 7 pm.</p>

                        <p>A Harris win is expected to have the opposite effect…</p>
                        <p>BTW to save you from wading through pages of fluff.</p>
                        <p class="emph">Here's how I interpret the election scenarios, without getting too deep into the weeds:</p>
                        <p class="fsi">(And I am not an expert on this… I'm a mere trader trying to cobble together a half-decent roadmap for the 5th!)</p>
                        <p>Anything that's considered Bullish under a Trump win becomes more Bullish if Republicans win both the House and the Senate.</p>
                        <p>They are more likely to push through more aggressive policies without the other side forcing them to water things down.</p>
                        <p>The same goes with Harris.</p>
                        <p>A clean sweep gives them more power to push through what they want.</p>
                        <p>So, using oil as an example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Trump clean sweep</span> is theoretically 'max bullish' for oil stocks,</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Trump President, split Congress</span> would be 'moderately bullish',</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Harris President, split Congress</span> 'moderately bearish',</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Harris clean sweep</span> 'max bearish'</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            
                        <p>You get the idea…</p>
                        <p>In short, a unified government amplifies policy impacts, while a split government tempers them.</p>
                        <p>And not to sound like a broken record but that's all “theory”... anything can happen.</p>
                        <p class="emph">Price is king.</p>

                        <p>Often in trading, the big goals can seem so far away, almost unreachable.</p>
                        <p>You look at where you are now and think <span class="fsi">“I don't actually see a realistic path to get there”</span></p>
                        <p>That's ok…</p>
                        <p>I believe that the path starts to illuminate as you move forward. But you need to keep moving.</p>
                        <p>This is where tiny, focused goals come in.</p>
                        <p>Each day, work on <span class="emph">one small thing</span>.</p>
                        <p>Trying to fix everything in your trading often means fixing nothing.</p>
                        <p>Here's a helpful framework to keep it simple:</p>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p class="emph">#1 Set super clear goals... like "wait for my confirmation before entering" to keep yourself focused.</p>
                        <p>When goals are precise, you know exactly what to do and can focus all your energy there… none of that vague “improve entries” stuff.</p>
                        <p class="emph">#2 Stick to process-based goals like “follow my risk management on each trade”... the results will follow.</p>
                        <p>Focus on actions within your control, like sticking to a plan, because process is king in trading... results show up when the process is rock solid.</p>
                        <p class="emph">#3 Use tiny goals to build solid habits... for example, “note down why I'm taking this trade” creates clarity.</p>
                        <p>Think of it as laying bricks, these tiny goals add up to core trading habits like staying mindful and being crystal clear on each trade.</p>
                        <p class="emph">#4 Tiny examples: “identify 3 setups pre-market”, “pause 10 secs before each trade”, “log 1 lesson aftermarket.”</p>
                        <p>These small steps build consistency into your day; pre-market setups, a quick mental check-in before a trade, and a post-market review keep you grounded and sharp.</p>
                        <p class="emph">#5 Look back each week… missed a goal? Break it down even smaller, like “wait for one candle close” first.</p>
                        <p>A quick weekly review lets you adjust and spot any patterns. If a goal felt tough, make it even easier to hit next week by narrowing it down.</p>
                        <p class="emph">#6 Start easy and build from there… once you build a small habit, layer another on top.</p>
                        <p>Once a tiny goal feels routine, raise the bar just a bit, get consistent with one and then add another.</p>
                        <p>Tiny goals let you focus on the next small step… and a few small wins every day add up to decent growth.</p>
                        <p>Work out what your tiny goals are and build from there.</p>

A 0.3% m/m lift in US core CPI could see some questioning the pace of disinflation - should inflation be backed by a hotter-than-expected retail sales print and the USD index (DXY) should break 105.50 as the market reduces the prospect of a further 25bp cut in the December FOMC meeting.</p>

                        <p>In it, he breaks down how he spots market opportunities, handles risk, and executes massive trades with precision…</p>

                        <p>Stan's Playbook in a Nutshell:</p>
                        <p class="emph">Spot the Opportunity, Dig Deeper Later:</p>
                        <p>He's all about getting in fast when he sees a big trend, then diving into analysis once he's already riding the wave.</p>
                        <p class="emph">When You've Got Conviction, Go Big:</p>
                        <p><span class="gld">Learned from <span class="key">Soros</span>: when you know it's a winner, go all-in</span>. No halfway bets; like his pound short, where he doubled down because the odds were stacked in his favour.</p>
                        <p class="emph">Cut Losses without a Second Thought:</p>
                        <p>If the reason he bought no longer holds? He's out. Price paid? Doesn't matter… that's just sunk cost noise.</p>
                        <p class="emph">Tops, Bottoms, and Patterns:</p>
                        <p>This was interesting, he watches for tops by looking at the rate of change slowing, though he knows it could also be a bull flag prepping for a new leg.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it's a top, sometimes it's not, and that's ok.</p>
                        <p class="emph">Sector Rotation and Flexibility:</p>
                        <p>Bonds, equities, currencies, he trades them all. This approach helps him stick to trades with the best odds.</p>
                        <p class="emph">Analyst vs. Trader: Know Your Role</p>
                        <p>Great analysts can get stuck if they try to manage a portfolio without the stomach for it… not everyone's cut out for pulling the trigger. He's all about knowing when to switch gears.</p>
                        <p>This video is a real gem.</p>
                        <p>Watch it, and perhaps Druckenmiller's mindset could help you reshape the way you approach trading. (Also on Spotify.)</p>

                        <p>Well, price very rarely just touches a level and reverses.</p>
                        <p>It often over or undershoots, but the entry or target is probably still valid.</p>
                        <p>The trouble is, when we draw a thin line on a chart, if price goes to the other side of it, all we see is a "broken" level—when it might just be a noisy overshoot.</p>
                        <p>To put it simply, lines can play tricks on our brains.</p>
                        <p>I believe zones are a much better way to display levels.</p>
                        <p>Say you are planning a <strong>reversal trade</strong> around a <strong>key level</strong>. With a zone, that area becomes <span class="key">your area to do business…</span></p>
                        <p>While price is in that area, you can look for a candlestick pattern or <strong>tape flip</strong> to time the trade.</p>
                        <p>It's a far easier picture to decipher.</p>
                        <p>You can always do this manually using a box or rectangle drawing tool.</p>
                        <p>But I found a neat script on TradingView that allows you to plot the prior highs and lows (the most useful levels) using a box width of your choice. I used 25 pips in the charts above.</p>
                        <p>I don't know the guy, but hat tip to “nephew_sam” for this cool little tool.</p>
                        <p>How to access it on Trading View. &#x26D3; <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/script/gMQB15xA-Previous-OHLC-Nephew-Sam/" target="_blank">Previous OHLC (Nephew_Sam_)</a></p>
                        <p>Give it a try if you need prior high-low zones, or test out drawing your own.</p>
                        <p>I think you'll find it sharpens your view of price and its relationship to key levels.</p>

                        <p>With so much recent attention placed on US election trades and the initial discounting of Trump 2.0, Nvidia comes back firmly into the spotlight, with its Q325 earnings, and its guidance for Q425 (due Wednesday after market) expected to result in sharp moves in the post-market session. Naturally, one would expect any volatility in Nvidia's share price to influence the global semis space, as well as the broader S&P500 and NAS100.</p>
                        <p>For context, the options market prices an -/+8.8% move in Nvidia's share price on the day of earnings, in line with the average (absolute) move seen on earnings over the past 8 quarters.</p>
                        <p>Expectations of a blowout number (relative to consensus expectations) seem low compared to prior reporting quarters and the analyst community feels quietly confident in their ability to model Q325 sales, earnings, and gross margins and investor positioning is also more closely aligned to prior guidance.</p>
                        <p>That said, options traded over Nvidia expiring 22 November show large open interest and heavy call buying in the $145, $145, and $160 strikes, suggesting that options traders see a greater risk of the share price kicking higher on the earnings release. Guidance from the hyperscaler businesses suggests demand for GPUs is incredibly strong, so one can understand why options traders are positioned for near-term upside.</p>

                        <p>The good news? I think that all of these can be mitigated or at least reduced with some simple steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p><span class="emph">Slowing things down</span> - quick decisions are often based on <strong>fear</strong>, <strong>greed</strong> or <strong>wanting to be right</strong>. If you <span class="gld">take time to consider your decisions</span>, often that's enough just to <span class="key">think more clearly about things</span>.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="emph">Observing the tone of your self-talk</span> - Self-sabotage speaks a very different language from calm, collected market observations. Listen to the tone of your inner voice, does it sound emotive or clear and rational? That voice telling you to buy at the highs right now... Is it an objective assessment of momentum or emotional FOMO?</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="emph">Accountability</span> - It's a lonely business, you can be the most seasoned trader with a lovely track record and still fall foul to the isolation demons. Find a trading group, a trading buddy or a mentor. But choose carefully…</p></li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>A few questions each day before the bell to calibrate yourself to conditions and ensure you are in the right frame of mind to trade.</p>
                        <p>It would usually include questions like:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Because the last thing you want to be doing is rushing to the screens in your boxers scrambling to find a good trade…</p>
                        <p>So, get your checklist ready, and let's look at the next steps.</p>

                        <p>Now, open the mobile or desktop app, and start a new session using the advanced voice function.</p>
                        <p>It looks like this.</p>

                        <p>This super cool voice feature allows you to talk back and forth, asking questions.</p>
                        <p>Say something like:</p>
                        <p class="emph">“I am starting my trading day, I want you to run through my pre-market checklist questions, listen to my answers, and summarise them into a report”</p>
                        <p>Chat GPT will then guide you through your checklist questions, sometimes even mixing up the order to keep it fresh (unless you ask it not to).</p>
                        <p>All done via voice, so you can stay focused on the screens.</p>
                        <p>Once you're finished, it can compile a clean report for you to review (if you want it.)</p>
                        <p>No need to print off the PDF or jot things down.</p>
                        <p>You can even ask it to identify weaknesses in your daily plan or offer tips to improve your focus.</p>
                        <p>Over time, it learns and adapts, becoming your personal trading assistant.</p>
                        <p>This works great for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Pre-market checklists</p></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>It's perfect if you hate writing or prefer talking through ideas.</p>
                        <p class="key">Chat GPT can <strong>declutter your thoughts</strong>, <strong>understand what you're aiming for</strong>, and <strong>document everything for you</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The AI tech just keeps getting better.</p>
                        <p>If we stay ahead of it and think about practical trading applications, it's only going to enhance our edge.</p>

                        <p>Something a bit different today.</p>
                        <p>A lot of traders are curious about automation, maybe you're a discretionary trader looking to add a few algos to your system, or just want to explore the idea of automating your strategy.</p>
                        <p>So let's explore one way of doing it. (Especially if you're new to automation.)</p>
                        <p>Now, if you use MT4 or MT5, you can simply run your Expert Advisers from there and automate your trading that way.</p>
                        <p>But what about if you use Trading View?</p>
                        <p>What if you want to build and test your strategies on there?</p>
                        <p>Well, sadly, you can't actually automate your trades through them, yet.</p>
                        <p>But there is a workaround.</p>
                        <p class="fsi">I warn you though, it's a bit clunky, but if you are happy and familiar with Trading View and just want to sprinkle a bit of automation into your trading, then this is one way to do it.</p>

                            <li><p><span class="emph">A strategy that fires orders</span> (build your own or download one from Trading View).</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="emph">An MT4 or MT5 account</span> (this is where the trades will be executed).</p></li>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>Here's how to make it work:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>Get a tool that connects TradingView to MT4/5. One popular option is Pine Connector &#x2693;<a href="https://www.pineconnector.com/" target="_blank">https://www.pineconnector.com/</a>, which has been around for a while. Their starter package costs $29.90 per month.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Keep MT4/5 running continuously. You'll need a VPS to do this. A VPS is like having a computer that's always on, so trades can trigger automatically. A good option is Forex VPS &#x2693;<a href="https://www.forexvps.net/" target="_blank">https://www.forexvps.net/</a>, which costs around £15 a month. You can log in from anywhere, load MT4/5, and manage your account.</p></li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="emph">Set up TradingView alerts.</p>
                                <p>The process works through TradingView's alert system. Here's a quick breakdown:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Configure your strategy in TradingView to fire alerts.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>When an alert triggers, it sends a webhook signal to Pine Connector, including trade details.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Pine Connector then relays the details to MT4/5 through its custom EA (Expert Advisor).</p></li>
                                        <li><p>MT4/5 receives the signal and executes the trade.</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>You can adjust parameters like risk rules and safety mechanisms, but that's essentially how it works.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Would I recommend <strong>scalping</strong> with this setup? Probably not. But it's a solid way to start automating some of your ideas.</p>
                        <p>PS: If you need a developer to help you get set up with all this, I have one I've used for years. Happy to put you in touch.</p>

                        <p>The prospects of a seasonal “Santa Claus” rally in US equity do the rounds again, and statistically this phenomenon is given real credence by how the S&P500 has performed going into December. Using 20 years of monthly S&P500 returns, in the years that the S&P500 was up by 10% or more between Jan-Nov, the S&P500 saw an average monthly gain in December of 2.2%, with the S&P500 closing higher in December in 90% of occurrences.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the S&P500 has gained 24.7% YTD, subsequently increases the prospect of a chase by active managers into year-end and raises the prospects of seeing “Santa” used more liberally in market commentary. It also suggests a need for <strong>pension funds</strong>, <strong>mutual funds</strong>, and <strong>sovereign wealth funds</strong> to <strong>rebalance</strong>, and that may be countering force to those chasing performance into year-end.</p>

                        <p>Facing potential trade wars with both the United States and China, a ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions to its East, creeping energy prices and a German election early next year, the euro's 4% fall so far in November is its biggest monthly loss since April 2022 - the month after Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>
                        <p>With another set of dire business surveys showing German and euro zone activity contracting this month, the euro plunged to two-year lows of $1.033 on Friday. And pressure is mounting on the European Central Bank to accelerate its easing just as the Federal Reserve hesitates with further rate cuts stateside.</p>
                        <p>Money markets are now leaning towards a fourth ECB rate cut of the year next month of as much as 50 basis points to 2.75%, while futures still see little more than a 50% chance the Fed will move at all next month.</p>
                        <p>At just shy of 230 basis points, the two-year U.S.-German bond yield gap is at its widest since 2022 as well.</p>
                        <p>Alongside the latest gloomy business surveys, Russia's increasingly pointed nuclear threats and extraordinary missile strikes on Ukraine this week have jarred the continent anew as Moscow eyes the isolationist stance of Donald Trump's incoming U.S. administration as an opportunity to bolster its position.</p>
                        <p>And European wholesale gas prices hovered near annual highs after fresh U.S. sanctions on Russia's Gazprombank raised fears over what remains of gas supplies from Russia, just as cold temperatures led to drawdowns in Europe's gas stores.</p>

                            <p>But the prospect of Trump catalyzing global trade wars in which Europe would be left most exposed was perhaps the biggest economic cloud gathering.</p>
                            <p>In the starkest warning so far from the ECB about the consequences of a trade war, the central bank's chief economist Philip Lane said on Thursday that global economic output would suffer a "sizeable" loss, while any immediate boost to inflation would fade over a few years.</p>
                            <p>The euro's losses, meantime, have catapulted the dollar higher across the planet - with the dollar index also hitting its best levels since 2022 and now up more than 6% for the year to date. China's yuan briefly hit its weakest since July.</p>
                            <p>Bitcoin touched a fresh record high of $99,380 on Friday, with its sights set firmly on the $100,000 barrier, amid hopes of a more friendly regulatory environment under Trump.</p>
                            <p>Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to <span class="key">accumulate a <strong>national stockpile</strong> of bitcoin</span>.</p>
                            <p>And crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who said on Thursday he would step down in January when Trump takes office.</p>

                            <p>It's not possible yet, but there are some workarounds, depending on what you want to do.</p>
                            <p>Let's explore…</p>

                            <p>None of these are true real-time data yet but it won't be long until Chat GPT just links right into a real-time price feed seamlessly.</p>
                            <p>But for now, AFAIK this is what we've got.</p>

                                        <p class="emph bld">Upload the data using a CSV file</p>
                                        <p>I covered this in a webinar. You can download price data from Trading View and upload it into Chat GPT for analysis. Useful depending on what you are trying to do. Not real-time, but good for analysis and simple strategy testing.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p class="emph bld">Screenshot a chart</p>
                                        <p>Yes, this works (kinda). You can paste a screenshot of a chart and ask Chat GPT to tell you what it sees or a specific question. It does state the obvious sometimes but it could be a good process to help you <span class="key">workshop through a trade idea</span>.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            <p>Not groundbreaking, but useful for a lot of things.</p>
                            <p>As soon as there's a way to hook up real-time price data I'll let you know.</p>

                            <p>In it, he explains how changing trading behaviours, especially overtrading starts with <span class="emph">identifying your triggers</span>.</p>

                        <p>Looking at the calendar for the week ahead, we see a number of important data points that will massage market expectations around the potential policy actions from the 8 G10 central bank meetings between 11-19 December. Looking at current market pricing we see that in six of these rates/swaps traders are torn on the potential outcome for policy change. Subsequently, the market requires new data and/or central banker guidance to really increase conviction levels.</p>
                        <p>Typically, when we see the market split on an interest rate decision, it can often lead to increased volatility in the respective currency and even on a cross-asset basis.</p>

                        <p>As can we this pricing in the graphic, there is indecision as to the next move from the Fed, BoC, SNB, ECB, BoJ and Riksbank. The BoJ is offered a 66% chance of a 25bp hike 25bp on 19 December. The market is also yet to be fully convinced that the Fed cut rates at the upcoming FOMC meeting (also on 19 December), with current pricing in US interest rates swaps implying a 65% chance of a cut. The BoC, SNB and ECB meetings also interest, as we see a healthy debate between a 25bp vs 50bp cut - suggesting increasing volatility in the CAD, CHF, and EUR.</p>
                        <p>Reduced liquidity will be a factor as we roll through the month, but so could a potential performance chase from active managers (to beat their set benchmark) with end-of-year rebalancing flows also due to impact - when these dynamics reconcile with uncertainty as to various central banks next move, anyone hoping for a quiet last month of the calendar year may be disappointed.</p>

                        <h3>The key event risks to navigate this week</h3>
                        <p>Much of the attention will fall on the week's US economic data flow and how it could influence the Fed's thinking. There is a whole list of US data points that could rock markets, notably should we see an outcome that deviates significantly from the consensus, but the data points which hold the greatest possibility of moving the dial are the ISM manufacturing, ISM services, and the nonfarm payrolls print.</p>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>US data has been missing expectations of late, and we can see the Citi US economic surprise index falling from 43 to 27. Down, but not out by any means, and few are currently talking about increasing recession risk. But a further fall in the surprise indices - driven by below-expectation data outcomes - and the USD selling momentum will only increase.</p>
                        <p>The prospect of negative USD returns in December have increased and given what's priced (in the interest rates table) and the fact that there is a higher risk that the Fed cut by 25bp, as does the ECB, with the BoJ a real chance of hiking by 25bp, tactical shorts in the USD seem compelling.</p>
                        <p>USD bulls will want to see the ISM manufacturing reports push towards and even above the 50 expansionary read - they will also want to see the various US labour market reads show improvement and stave off any signs of further signs of cooling.</p>

                        <h3>US nonfarm payrolls is the marquee event risk for the week</h3>
                        <p>Naturally, it's the US nonfarm payrolls (NFP) which will get the greatest level of attention. The economist's consensus is for 200k jobs to have been created in November, with the range of estimates seen between 270k and 155k - a potentially healthy snapback after the weather and strike impacted October print (of 12k jobs).</p>
                        <p>While next week's US CPI print will also be an important input, an NFP print above 230k-250k, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.1%, will have some questioning if the Fed should cut rates at all in December. A jobs report between 160k to 190k with an unchanged U/E rate of 4.1% is likely the sweet spot for risk, as it keeps a December cut in play but is also a healthy level of job creation.</p>
                        <p>The US 2-year Treasuries and the USD (notably USDJPY) are the clearest expressions of a strong/weaker NFP print. I suspect that it would take a truly weak NFP (below 100k with a higher U/E rate) to derail the US equity juggernaut, and after the S&P500 printed its 54th ATH for the year on Friday, the wind is clearly to its back.</p>
                        <p>Offering some degree of guidance, we hear from 10 different Fed speakers through the week, including the more influential Christopher Waller and Chair Jay Powell - the appetite expressed for a cut in December, and the pace of easing ongoing could move markets. Fed members Goolsbee, Hammack and Daly speak after the NFP print, with traders looking to see how the jobs report influences their call on a cut in December.</p>

                        <h3>The BoC to cut by 25bp or 50bp on 11 December?</h3>
                        <p>In Canada, we see the November employment report on Friday, which is expected to show that 25k jobs were created, with the U/E rate ticking up to 6.6%. With CAD interest rate swaps pricing a 25bp vs 50bp cut as a lineball call, the jobs report could go some way in influencing that debate, in turn, injecting increased volatility into the CAD. USDCAD looks good for a 1.4100 to 1.3930 range, and these levels that define my risk in USDCAD trades. A close below 1.3951 would certainly start interest in positioning for further downside in the pair.</p>

                        <p>Elsewhere, we see Switzerland and Sweden's Nov CPI print which could cement a 50bp and 25bp cut respectively from the SNB and Riksbank. In Australia, we see Oct retail sales, and Q3 GDP, although the data this week shouldn't affect the markets view on impending RBA action - if anything, better data should be best expressed in the equity market where the ASX200 looks to take out last week ATH of 8477, with SPI futures needing a closing break of 8509.</p>

                                <p>Charlie lasted three months before throwing in the towel.</p>
                                <p>That's nowhere near enough time to learn the business, spread the word, and establish a brand in the community.</p>
                                <p>Maybe he thought he'd be crushing it from day one.</p>
                                <p>Trading isn't much different.</p>
                                <p>It's tempting to think that textbook tactics will instantly unlock profits, but we both know that's not true.</p>

                                <p>If you went to his house you'd get a proper decent cup!</p>

                                <p>Charlie said he wanted to create a community, a place to come and enjoy great coffee.</p>
                                <p>Yet he had hardly anywhere to sit. His shop was pretty grubby looking, and by his own admission, was freezing!</p>
                                <p>Not very inviting.</p>
                                <p>The same goes for trading.</p>

                                <p>Anyway, that's my take on it, do you agree?</p>
                                <p>Some of the best trading lessons come from completely different areas: sports, art, politics, and business. It's all about <strong>observing</strong> and <strong>reframing</strong>.</p>

                            <p>I once had a disagreement with a trader who said:</p>
                            <p class="fsi">“Scaling out is weak behaviour and should not be done”</p>
                            <p>Now on paper, there's some merit to that.</p>
                            <p>If you're in a trade with a well-planned risk/reward structure, you could argue that scaling out dilutes your edge.</p>
                            <p>Maybe…</p>
                            <p>But my reply was this:</p>
                            <p class="emph">"Sometimes in trading, your actions focus on strengthening your mindset and psychology rather than pure efficiency."</p>
                            <p>And what I mean by that is this.</p>
                            <p>Imagine you're long:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>The market goes bid and starts moving in your direction</p></li>
                                    <li><p>It hits a big level and starts to stall out</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Your judgement suggests it could reverse here, but you also have a higher target in mind</p></li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>So, what do you do?</p>
                            <p>Most traders face a binary decision: <span class="emph">close the trade</span> or <span class="emph">hold the trade</span>.</p>
                            <p>And that can be tough...</p>
                            <p>If you hold and it reverses, it can be a confidence killer, especially for developing traders, even if it's technically the "right" thing to do.</p>
                            <p>That's where scaling comes in.</p>
                            <p>Take off half the position and hold the rest.</p>
                            <p>This soothes the inner voice urging you to close the trade, while still keeping you in the game for the bigger move.</p>
                            <p>Over time, you can analyse your results and see what works best for you.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>If the data shows you should hold longer, start scaling out smaller and smaller until you're confident enough to hold the entire position.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>If the data shows your edge lies in scaling earlier, adjust accordingly and lean into that strength.</p></li>
                                </ul>

                        <h3>A playbook for US nonfarm payrolls</h3>
                        <div class="para-inn">
                            <p>In that guise, those positioned for upside in equity would want an NFP print that comes in between <span class="emph">150k to 200k, with a U/E rate at 4.1%-4.2%</span>. This outcome portrays a healthy level of job creation but would keep a 25bp Fed rate cut on 18 Dec as the firm base case. I suspect the USD would be offered in this scenario, partly because the consensus is for 220k jobs, but also because the rates/swaps traders move past a key event risk (the other being next week's US CPI print) without any major shock and subsequently the implied chance of a 25bp cut would rise from its current implied of 70%</p>
                            <p>With other recent labour data points (released through the week) suggesting the labour market to be in good health, an outcome that comes in below <span class="emph">100k with a U/E rate at 4.2%, and certainly at 4.3%</span>, could see equity under pressure even if this all but assures a 25bp rate cut. The USD would be sold across the board, although USDJPY shorts and even EURUSD longs would work well.</p>
                            <p>We also need to consider how markets could fare on a strong outcome. Some may see a risk that an NFP print above 250k with the U/E rate at or below 4.1% could lead to markets derisking as it raises the possibility that the Fed hold off from easing on 18 Dec. I'd take the other side of that view and feel US equity will overlook the lower implied probability of a rate cut with a healthy labour market as the trumping factor. Naturally, the USD should rally hard across the board in this outcome.</p>

                            <p>It will be a lively week ahead with event risk all over the shop, so the risk manager in all who choose to be active in the markets this week will need to be aware of the landmines, and consider the potential for movement over the news, and where the skew in directional risk lies.</p>
                            <p>Looking at the calendar (above), we see 4 G10 central bank meetings (RBA, BoC, ECB, and SNB), US CPI and PPI, Aussie employment, China CPI, and trade data. In Japan, we get Q3 GDP (final), and the Q4 Tankan report.</p>

                            <h4>The US</h4>
                            <div class="para-inn">
                                <p>Friday's US nonfarm payrolls report was a goldilocks outcome for risk, with the lift in the U/E rate to 4.2% pushing the implied probability of a 25bp cut from the Fed next week to 84%, while the 227k jobs created in November kept concerns of a cooling labour market at bay. With the Fed looking more closely at the labour market (over inflation), and with recent speeches from the likes of Christopher Waller essentially lowering the bar to a cut next week, this week's US core CPI print would need to be above 0.4% m/m to have people really questioning a cut next week.</p>
                                <p><span class="key">A hot US CPI print may not necessarily derail a cut at next week's FOMC meeting, but it would affect the level of implied cuts priced for FOMC meetings from March 2025 onwards and this is where the USD may take its <strong>directional steer</strong></span>. We also need to remember that it's the elements from the CPI basket that feed into the core PCE deflator calculation that are of most interest, as this is what the Fed set policy too. In this regard, the inputs from the PPI print that also feed into core PCE will also be of importance.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h4>Australia</h4>
                            <div class="para-inn">
                                <p>The RBA won't cut rates this week, but after last week's weaker Q3 GDP print, the tone of the statement will be monitored closely. Aus IR swaps are torn on the idea of a February 25bp cut and price this as a lineball call, and as new data emerges the market will massage expectations on whether the RBA commence easing in February or April. Thursday's employment report will therefore take on more significance than usual, with a weaker employment print likely pushing the implied probability of a 25bp cut in Feb to around 75%.</p>
                                <p>AUDUSD closed a YTD low, and rallies will likely be sold on the week with the upside likely capped at 0.6470.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h4>Canada</h4>
                            <div class="para-inn">
                                <p>The Bank of Canada (BoC) meet on Wednesday and looks set to cut rates by 50bp with the IR swaps market pricing an 80% chance of this outcome. A 50bp cut could still negatively impact the CAD, and push USDCAD into and above 1.4200, but a lesser 25bp cut would likely cause the bigger - more CAD-positive - reaction. A 50bp cut with a statement suggesting they are closer to their perceived trough rate (or the low point in the cutting cycle) could see traders reverse bearish CAD exposures in a quick fashion.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h4>Europe</h4>
                            <div class="para-inn">
                                <p>The ECB will almost certainly cut rates by 25bp to 3% on Thursday (Friday 00:15 AEDT), although one could argue they should cut by 50bp given the recent economic data flow. <span class="key">The fact we see a small premium for a 50bp cut suggests if we do get a 25bp cut we could see a small positive reaction in the EUR, <strong>although the bigger reaction will come from the ECB's guidance and the appetite for future cuts</strong></span>. The market continues to look ahead at how far the ECB could take the rates, with the central view that the trough rate in the cycle is closer to 1.75%.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h4>Switzerland</h4>
                            <div class="para-inn">
                                <p>For traders holding CHF positions, Thursday's Swiss National Bank (SNB) meeting must be on the radar, with IR swaps market split in its view of a 25bp and 50bp cut. <span class="key">This <strong>indecisive pricing</strong> will likely result in an <strong>initial spike higher/lower</strong> in <strong>USDCHF</strong> and the CHF <strong>cross rates</strong></span> - Great for those who have a strong conviction on the likely outcome and want to punt the meeting, but for others, this is a risk that will need to be carefully considered whether to hold exposures over the event.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h4>Japan</h4>
                            <div class="para-inn">
                                <p>With the market having reacted to hawkish press reports and paring back expectations of a 25bp hike at next week's BoJ meeting to a 1-in-3 chance and seeing January as more likely time for a hike. This week's Q3 (final) GDP and Q4 Tankan data will need to be significantly strong enough to bring the hike firmly back on the table. The BoJ will look most closely at the Tankan report and the outlooks offered by large and smaller manufacturing and service enterprises. They may also want to see the next CPI print, which is due on the 20 Dec and after next week's meeting.</p>
                            </div>
                            <h4>China</h4>
                            <div class="para-inn">
                                <p>Throughout the week we see China CPI, trade balance, and credit data (new yuan loans, aggregate financing). We also navigate headlines from China's Central Economic Work Conference (11-12 Dec), although expectations of any market-moving fiscal policy announcements are low, and authorities will likely bring out the big guns post-tariff negotiations with the Trump Administration. On the week USDCNH interests, where a retest and potential upside break of 7.3145 (3 Dec high) could weigh on AUD, NZD, and CAD. On the equity side, I have the HK50 index on the radar, with the index finding 19,770 a tough level to break - subsequently, an upside break here could be worth chasing.</p>

                            <img src="./assets/images/Dec/Trigger.jpg" alt="Trigger.jpg">

                            <p class="emph">"What specific trigger am I waiting for?"</p>
                            <p>Think about it…how often do traders jump into trades because they <span class="fsi">feel</span> the market might move?</p>
                            <p>Or worse, because they're bored, or the chart just “looks good”?</p>
                            <p>That's where discipline falls apart.</p>
                            <p>Here's the rule for today: <span class="emph">No trigger, no trade.</span></p>
                            <p class="gld">Your edge as a trader doesn't come from <strong>reacting</strong>; it comes from <strong>waiting</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Waiting for the <span class="fsi">right</span> trigger.</p>
                            <p>This might mean:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>A price breaking a key level <span class="fsi key">with strong volume</span>.</p></li>
                                <li><p>A probe under a key support level.</p></li>
                                <li><p>A close above a prior high after a certain time of day.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You get the idea…</p>
                            <p>Whatever your setup is, write it down. <span class="emph">Be specific.</span></p>
                            <p>Because when the market moves, you'll face the temptation to bend your rules…thinking “It's close enough” or “I don't want to miss out.”</p>
                            <p>But that's how <strong>second-guessing</strong> and <strong>overtrading</strong> sneak in… and you're better than that!</p>
                            <p class="emph bld">Here's the goal for today:</p>
                            <p class="gld">Before the open, take 30 seconds to <strong>define your setups</strong> and <strong>triggers</strong>. Write it down. Stick to it.</p>
                            <p class="gld">If you don't see it, you sit on your hands.</p>
                            <p class="emph">Your discipline today will build your edge tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>USD traders are set to navigate today's US CPI print, although expectations that the inflation data will lead to pronounced moves in rates, US Treasuries and the USD are low. With the market looking for both headline and core CPI to come in at 0.3% m/m (annualised core CPI unchanged at 3.3% y/y), <span class="key">we may need to see a core CPI print firmly above 0.4% m/m to get the USD pumping</span>. With a low bar for the Fed to ease next week, the US CPI print is unlikely to derail that outcome, although it could throw some doubt into the mix, and more importantly impact expectations and pricing towards policy changes in future Fed meetings. Conversely, <span class="key">a CPI print that rounds down to 0.2% would bring out better USD sellers and could lift sentiment towards risky assets (equity)</span>.</p>

                            <p>Sounds simple, right?</p>
                            <p>But think about it… how often do we dive into the session without preparing for a potential rough start?</p>
                            <p>And when that loss hits, what happens?</p>
                            <p>Disappointment, frustration… maybe even overtrading or chasing bad setups to "get it back."</p>
                            <p>Sure, in a perfect world, you wouldn't feel that way. But you're human, and sometimes those negative emotions creep in with an early loss.</p>
                            <p>So today, let's prepare for it.</p>
                            <p>This is the plan: If your first trade is a loser, you shrug it off and stay on track.</p>

                            <h4>Here's How to Handle It:</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Acknowledge the Loss:</span> Remind yourself that losses are part of the game.</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Pause and Review:</span> Was it a good trade that just didn't work out? Or was it outside your plan?</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Refocus:</span> Stick to your process. The next trade doesn't care about the last one, neither should you…</p></li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Here's the thing… the first trade doesn't define your day, but how you <span class="fsi emph">respond</span> to it does.</p>
                            <p>So, take 30 seconds right now.</p>
                            <p>Write down your plan for handling that first loss.</p>
                            <p>Because the more you prepare for adversity, the less likely it is to derail you.</p>

                        <h3>The risk from the FOMC meeting</h3>
                        <div class="para-inn">
                            <p>The market sees a 25bp cut from the Fed as a done deal and expects Jay Powell to stress that the Fed remains open to further easing, with the pace and magnitude of future cuts conditional on the incoming data flow. Policy optionality as we head into an uncertain Q125 seems assured. A new set of quarterly economic projections and 'Dots' will also be widely dissected and should offer some steer to current market pricing. We can expect tweaks to the Fed's 2025 and 2026 forecasts for unemployment, GDP and inflation, although these changes shouldn't be overly market-moving.</p>
                            <p>The 'dots' (each voting member's estimate on where the Fed funds rate could be in the years ahead) could impact markets. As we see in the table, the consensus view from economists is that the median dot for 2025 is likely to be raised to 3.625% (from 3.375%), and to 3.125% (from 2.875%) in 2026, highlighting a central tendency for three 25bp cuts next year and two 25 bp cuts in 2026. The long-run neutral rate is expected to be taken up to 3%.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    </div>
                    <div class="para">
                        <p>One could therefore argue that the bear case for the USD / the equity positive outcome would be if the Fed left the 2025 dot unchanged, signaling a median view of 100bp of cuts for 2025 - although this would be a surprise, especially if the collective within the Fed's ranks upgrade its growth and U/E forecasts. The hawkish risk is seen if the median dot for 2025 was raised to 3.875%, in turn, signaling two 25bp cuts in 2025.</p>

                        <h3>The US Treasury market is the central guide for risk this week</h3>
                        <div class="para-inn">
                            <p>All eyes fall on the reaction in the US Treasury market. With the US 10-year real rate back above 2%, and the 10-year (nominal) Treasury rising a punchy 24bp last week and fast approaching 4.50%, it feels as though the US bond market will play an increased role in shaping the volatility in equity, FX and gold this week. Higher yields and a steeper yield curve, especially if not backed by a solid improvement in the US data flow, will likely become more of a headwind for equity risk.</p>

                        <p>Reuters Morning Bid U.S. |<small> morningbid@thomsonreuters.com </small>| 2:15 PM</p>
                        <hr class="dot">
                    </div>
                    <div class="para">
                        <p>Bitcoin is back in the headlines today, having vaulted above $105,000 for the first time on record, after a nod from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to make crypto great again. In an interview on Thursday with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Trump suggested he could go ahead with plans to create a strategic bitcoin reserve, much like the country's strategic oil reserve.</p>
                        <p>"We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don't want China or anybody else - not just China but others are embracing it - and we want to be the head," Trump said.</p>
                        <p>It's fairly vague, but, together with the inclusion of MicroStrategy - a software firm that is the world's biggest corporate owner of bitcoin - into the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, it's been enough to ignite a new push higher in the price on Monday. Next stop - $110,000?</p>
                        <p>MicroStrategy owns nearly 425,000 coins, worth around $45 billion at current levels, equivalent to about 2% of bitcoin's total market value, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Indeed, shares in the company are up around 6% in pre-market trading already.</p>
                        <p>Crypto has been a major beneficiary of flows in the so-called "Trump trade", on the premise that the incoming administration will take a more relaxed approach to regulation in general and with crypto in particular.</p>
                    </div>
                    <hr class="dash">
                    <div class="para">
                        <p>How a strategic reserve of bitcoin, whose supply is capped at 21 million coins, would work is not clear. Governments own around 13.9% of total supply, according to BitcoinTreasuries, with the United States and China vying for the position of biggest. The U.S. has just shy of 200,000 coins - 0.943% of total market cap -, worth $20.7 billion, while China owns 190,000, or 0.905% of the market.</p>
                        <p>Bitcoin has risen by over 190% this year. The launch of U.S. exchange-traded funds in January linked to the spot price have brought in nearly $35 billion in investment flows, according to LSEG data. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has been the largest recipient, with over 500,000 coins, according to BitcoinTreasuries data.</p>
                        <p>BlackRock itself said last week it recommends interested investors allocate as much as 2% of their portfolios to bitcoin, citing, among other things, its potential as a diversifier, given that it tends not to move in lockstep with other major asset classes.</p>
                        <p>Trump said on the campaign trail that, if elected, his administration would commit to keeping 100% of all the bitcoin the government owns or acquires in the future.</p>

                        <h3>Big bitcoin reserve might curb trade</h3>
                            <div class="para-inn">
                                <p>The snag for crypto devotees is a big reserve would mean fewer tokens for investors to trade. It would also risk creating serious turbulence in the market if the government ever did sell part of that stockpile.</p>
                                <p>Suggestions for how it might work have included the Federal Reserve possibly managing the reserves for the Treasury Department, much as it does with gold. Alternatively, a bitcoin stockpile could look more like the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where both the president and Congress have varying amounts of control, experts say.</p>
                                <p>Either way, Trump appears keen to display his pro-crypto credentials. <span class="key">He's named former PayPal executive David Sacks as White House czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies</span>. He's also said he would nominate pro-crypto Washington attorney Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is more pro-deregulation than pro-crypto, specifically, but his appointment would mark a departure from hard-charging SEC Chair Gary Gensler.</p>

                            <p>Crypto also gets the full attention of traders, with Bitcoin the primary target of our client flows, with increasing activity on the break out of the recent consolidation highs, with our price reaching a high of $107,819. The technicals clearly offer an overview that the buyers are back in the driving seat and bossing the show, with <span class="key"><strong>sentiment shaped</strong> once again by the head spokesman of the movement - Michael Saylor - who unsurprisingly is capitalising on the inclusion of MicroStrategy into the Nasdaq 100 by <strong>selling shares and buying an additional $1.5b worth of Bitcoin</strong></span> - the rally through Asia yesterday clearly driven by trader's front-running this dynamic.</p>
                            <p>The fact that Trump has spoken out about his desire for a BTC Strategic Reserve offers a further shot in the arm to confidence levels. Although the idea of a Strategic Reserve still feels like a secondary effect to the additional <strong>BTC</strong> buying from <strong>MicroStrategy</strong>, and while many in the <strong>TradeFi</strong> world take a sceptical view that a Strategic Reserve will play out anytime soon, we must remain open-minded to the fact that if anyone is going to get it done it would be <strong>Trump</strong>. And should it become a consensus view then we can expect significant upside in the BTC price.</p>
                            <p>There is little doubt that if the US were to head down this route, then it wouldn't be the only government to accumulate Bitcoin, and that could be a major kicker for the project in 2025.</p>

                            <p>US retail sales is the big event risk in the session ahead, and while the outcome won't alter the idea that the Fed will cut rates this week, <span class="key">a strong retail print (the market eyes +0.6% m/m on the advanced read and 0.4% m/m on the control group) would push long-end Treasury yields higher.</span></p>

                            <p>That's the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) on steroids.</p>
                            <p>The same principle applies to trading:</p>

                            <p>Is the line between success and failure really that thin?</p>
                            <p>If I miss a few good trades, will it really impact my results that much?</p>
                            <p class="emph">Maybe, but we can use this to our advantage.</p>
                            <p>By understanding Pareto's principle, <span class="key">you can focus your <strong>time</strong> and <strong>energy</strong> on the areas that move the needle most:</span></p>

                                <li><p>How can I go bigger on my best trades?</p></li>

                                <li><p>How can I save my focus and screen time for when it truly matters?</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The best traders embrace Pareto's principle.</p>
                            <p><span class="key">Just like a smart investor stays fully invested through <strong>market dips</strong></span>, a smart trader uses the 80/20 rule to their advantage:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Pressing hard</span> when things are going well.</p></li>

                            <p>Take a moment to reflect:</p>

                            <p>Your choice comes down to a few things:</p>
                            <ul class="emph">
                                <li><p>Experience level</p></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>If you get frustrated by a lack of progress, waiting around for home runs while getting stopped out on false starts probably isn't the best fit.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes, stringing together a few wins can boost your confidence, fuel momentum, and improve your trading overall.</p>
                            <p>On the flip side, if you thrive on patience and can handle dry spells, swinging for those big wins could be your edge.</p>
                            <p>If you're in a drawdown, it's quite comforting to know one decent trade can pull you out of it.</p>
                            <p>But, like everything in this game…it's your trading and your choice.</p>
                            <p class="key">Perhaps take some time to consider which style suits you best… and commit to being great at it.</p>
                            <p class="key">Because when you lean into what works for you, everything changes.</p>

                            <p>Otherwise, you are in danger of slipping into a 'trading not to lose' mentality…</p>

                            <p>Here's the difference:</p>
                            <p>When you're <span class="emph">trading to win</span>, you:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Take trades that align with your edge, even if they feel uncomfortable.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Let your winners run to their full potential most of the time.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Accept losses as part of the game and move on.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Push in size when you know you should</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>But when you're <span class="emph">trading not to lose</span>, it's a whole different story:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>You hesitate to pull the trigger, second-guessing every setup.</p></li>
                                <li><p>You close trades too early, cutting profits short out of fear.</p></li>
                                <li><p>You avoid risk entirely, missing Grade A opportunities.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Trade smaller size to avoid risk</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Ironically trading not to lose means you'll almost certainly… lose!</p>
                            <p>That's the way the market gods operate 🙂</p>
                            <p>So, if you find yourself falling into that trap, give yourself a quick reminder.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Focus on the Process, Not the Outcome:</span> Just execute the plan, accept the risk and play the game.</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Reframe Losses:</span> A loss is the cost of doing business, suck it up. If you don't want to lose, stop trading until you can reframe that thinking.</p></li>
                                <li><p><span class="emph">Define Your Targets and Stick to Them:</span> Set your usual risk and target parameters and then leave the trade. Your meddling with things is almost certainly born out of fear.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>And if you still feel you can't get in the right mental space, stop trading for a bit, and take a step back until you can get dialled in.</p>
                            <p>Often a day or two of no trading is all you need to remind yourself you're playing this game to dominate and crush it… so please behave accordingly!</p>

                            <p class="fsi">(Rumours went around about why he never used his name—more on that in the article below.)</p>
                            <p>It was definitely an edge at times, not every day, but some days it was priceless.</p>

                            <p>If you're thinking about trading between Christmas movies and mince pies, ask yourself this:</p>
                            <p class="emph">Am I trading with intention, or just taking a punt? Hoping to bank a few quid.</p>
                            <p>Because there's a big difference.</p>
                            <p>When you trade half-heartedly:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>You skip the prep.</p></li>
                                <li><p>You take setups that aren't in your plan.</p></li>
                                <li><p>And you're more likely to chase losses or revenge trade.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>But when you trade with focus, even during Christmas week you:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Stick to your edge, no matter how tempting that “quick win” looks.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Prepare as if it's any other trading day.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Only take trades that you'd proudly journal later.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>So here's something to consider:</p>
                            <p class="emph bld">If you're not ready to give the markets 100% of your attention, don't trade.</p>
                            <p>Enjoy the downtime instead.</p>
                            <p>The market will still be there after the New Year, far better to come back refreshed than frustrated at an unnecessary loss.</p>
                            <p>But if you do decide to trade?</p>
                            <p>Great, there's opportunity out there right now. But make it count.</p>
                            <p>Treat it like any other trading day, not a quick punt between bites of turkey.</p>
                            <p class="gld">Do the prep, assess the risk, and trade the process.</p>
