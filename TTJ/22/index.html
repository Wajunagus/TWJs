                    <li><p>The Japanese yen has depreciated against the U.S dollar causing negative effects in the Asian country</p></li>
                    <li><p>Interest rate gap & other factors contributed to depreciation</p></li>
                    <li><p>Goldman Sachs analysts beleive there is still room for the dollar to rise against the yen</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Japanese yen has seen a significant decline against the U.S. dollar this year with the USD/JPY pair reaching a high of 150 in October this year before settling back to around 132.</p>
                <p>This depreciation has had adverse effects on Japan's households & businesses including an increased financial burden & lower wages relative to the U.S dollar, as well as exacerbating labor shortages in the country.</p>
                <p>The main factor behind the depreciation is the gap in interest rates between Japan & the U.S., with the U.S. Federal Reserve tightening financial conditions & the Bank of Japan refusing to take the same path. However, other factors are also @ play, including Japan's reliance on imports for energy & food, the increasing costs of those imports, & the deterioration of Japanese industry's competitiveness compared to American & European businesses.</p>
                <p>In response to this situation, the Bank of Japan(BOJ) recently widened the trading band for 10-year Japanese government bonds(JGBs), causing the U.S dollar value to drop sharply against the yen. However, the dollar recovered the following day.</p>
                <p>Goldman Sachs analysts beleive there is still room for the dollar to rise against the yen but are closing their long dollar/yen position due to the possibility of a more significant BOJ policy change. Goldman Sachs assumes that the BOJ's move was a technical adjustment & a sign that policy rates could be adjusted further in the coming months.</p>
                <p>There is also a discrepancy between the Federal Reserve's(Fed) projections for future interest rates & what financial markets expect. The Fed's median forecast, as shown in the dot plot, is for interest rates to be 5.125%, 4.125%, & 3.125% in 2023, 2024, & 2025 respectively. However market expectations are lower @ 3.818%, 2.651% & 2.49% for those respective years.</p>
                <p>This divergence in expectations could potentially lead to volatility in the future, as only one side will ultimately be proven correct.</p>
                <p>The USD/JPY completed a rising flag on Nov 23, a changing of the guard period between early bears locking in profits & latecomers. The continuation pattern achieved its implied target by Tuesday's plunge.</p>
                <p>Before the plunge, another possible rising flag, marked by the 200 DMA, indicates another leg down. My only issue with the 2nd flag is that it doesn't follow a flagpole, a sharp drop that prompts bears to cash out.</p>
                <p>Either way, these moves completed creating the head of a potential H&S top. All that remains is the right shoulder, then a selloff below the neckline connecting the lows situated above 130.</p>
                <p>This level's bullish stronghold could push prices up again, which would also fit the return move that follows a flag's breakout. That doesn't necessitate a downside breakout, completing a top.</p>
                <p>This technical uncertainty reflects the divergent outlook described above.</p>

                <h3>Trading Strategies</h3>
                    <p>Conservative traders should wait for a new high to go along with the extending uptrend or wait for the H&S to complete with a downside breakout below 128.50, then for a return move to confirm the neckline's resistance for a short position.</p>
                    <p>Moderate traders would short the rebound, then join moderate peers with a short.</p>
                    <p>Aggressive traders could go long now, buying into the bounce.</p>
