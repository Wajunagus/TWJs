But the tools abstract the servers away for you. In this intermediate JavaScript course, Software Engineer Justin Mitchel will teach you how to take a simple Node.js app and run it on AWS Lambda with a serverless Postgres database. He'll even show you how to automate deployment using GitHub Actions and Vercel.

She's worked as a software engineer for more than a decade at companies like GitHub and Glitch. Among her many accomplishments, she created the Electron team at GitHub. Electron is a library for building desktop apps using browser technologies. If you've used the desktop version of Slack, Figma, or VS Code, you've used Electron. We had such a fun time talking about her journey from architecture student to city hall to working at the highest levels of tech. (2 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app):</p>

            <div>Dr. Angela Yu | 12:17 AM</div>
                <p>Our brains are pretty efficient at saving space and energy. So if we just keep doing the same things, it throws away the repeated parts and just "diffs" the memories. Only storing the new events.</p>
                <p>So if day-in-day-out we keep doing the same things, wake up, drink coffee, go to work, eat lunch, work some more, go home, watch Netflix and then go to bed; none of that gets stored. It's only when something changes that you might remember that weird change. Like if you spilt a whole bottle of milk on yourself when you tried to make coffee, covered yourself in it and had to go through the rest of the workday smelling like a baby cow. You would remember that.</p>
                <p>So it seems like I've figured out the secret to life extension (sorry I kept it from you for this long). Do you want to live longer? Then just live more. Have more varied experiences. Walk a different way to work. Try a cortado instead of your usual flat white. Take up a new hobby. Wear something you would never wear. Say hi to that cute barista. If your life was a video game, don't race to complete all the levels. Instead, explore like your mum won't call you to dinner. Make your life a movie instead of a sitcom.</p>
                <p>On that note, I'll be spending next month in Paris learning how to cook better (and probably eat better). Si t'habites à Paris et tu veux qu'on se voie, DM moi sur Twitter/X @yu_angela.</p>

                <h3>Something I learnt about interviews</h3>
                    <p>This month, I've been interviewing what seems like a million candidates for our new frontend, backend and DevOps positions. Being on the other side of the interview table taught me a lot of new things about interviews. If you're interviewing for a new job, here are some tips.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Learn to break down problems. It's one of the most important skills for a developer, and it can be learnt. Don't do what one person did and just say "I give up, this interview is too hard". 
                                <a href="https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/11/breaking-down-tasks/">https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/11/breaking-down-tasks/</a></li>
                            <li>Don't use technical jargon to cover up a lack of knowledge. If your interviewer is technical, it can really backfire.</li>
                            <li>Revise data structures and algorithms. A lot of the technical interviews will be easier if you are proficient at DSA.</li>
                        </ol>

                <h3>Something I learnt about plain HTML, CSS, JS</h3>
                    <p>We live in a world wide web that is dominated by frameworks. I'm probably guilty of this too. I do love React a bit too much. But I came across this game made with pure HTML, CSS, and JS and it's awesome. 
                        <a href="https://www.flaminglunchbox.net/curvy?_hsmi=270433503&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-98Hs3gtcD3edmpvb1QlmACpzxUKbfhpGlv-JFKRaK5UjBHYNNZZrfWMWf8WASOgCKCLfeMqoD-vk-0p3YqWY_DhnNlZg">https://www.flaminglunchbox.net/curvy?_hsmi=270433503&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-98Hs3gtcD3edmpvb1QlmACpzxUKbfhpGlv-JFKRaK5UjBHYNNZZrfWMWf8WASOgCKCLfeMqoD-vk-0p3YqWY_DhnNlZg</a> It's also totally doable for any students who have completed my web development course. If you're looking for a cool weekend project to work your brain then try it out and see if you can build it.</p>
                        
                <h3>Something I learnt about writing</h3>
                    <p>I'm not a writer, but I do enjoy the process. As Paul Graham says, writing is a tool for thinking better. It also helps you make sense of what happens to you. There is no better example of this than the writing of Yassine Meskhout. He is a public defender and his experiences are what makes his writing so laugh-out-loud funny. Every time I read his pieces, I realise that the more interesting you are, the better your writing.</p>

                <h3>Student Website/App of the Month</h3>
                    <p>This month we chose iMirror, a free iOS app from our student Christopher Endress.</p>
                    <p>"Hi LAB, Thank you for creating such great educational content. Your commitment to authenticity and passion brings inspiration to all who follow along. Recently, I've made an app to enhance my own mental health journey. It's a reflective journal that builds upon the principles of emotional presence and meditation to encourage mindfulness. Although it's not very popular, I learned that the process of creating something in this way to be one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done."

The most inexperienced student didn't know what a website is, the most experienced works for Twitter as a developer. <span class="gld">The most important thing is <strong>perseverance</strong> and <strong>willingness to learn.</strong></span> If you have that then you'll do great!</p>

He's a Computer Science professor at University of Michigan, and he's taught coding to millions of students through his freeCodeCamp courses. We talk about what separates a “Master Programmer” from an average one. We delve into what he sees as the biggest shortcomings of university programs - even elite ones like the one he teaches at. We also discuss his theories on the recent tech layoffs, and his suggestions for how devs can stay ahead of recent breakthroughs in AI.

Well, freeCodeCamp just published a handbook that will help you understand RAG so you can use it in your AI models. Even if you don't have time to read the whole thing, I still encourage you to bookmark it for future reference.

                        <li><p>reeCodeCamp also just published a full-length book on how to design your own Microservices and deploy them to the cloud. Microservice Architecture is a software development approach where you build stand-alone apps that only do one specific thing. Then these Microservices call upon one another to get more complicated things done. This differs from the traditional Monolith approach, where everything's part of the same codebase. This intermediate book will teach you about Synchronous versus Async Communication, RESTful APIs, Protocol Buffers, Container Orchestration, CI/CD Pipelines, and more. It also features case studies from companies that have adopted Microservices, such as Amazon and Netflix.

John's also the creator of one of the most popular open source projects of all time: Coding Interview University. This is John's first-ever appearance on a podcast, so we go really in-depth. We talk about his years working as an interpreter in the US military. Then we dive into how he taught himself software engineering, and what he's learned from climbing the ranks at a big tech company. If you're learning to code later in life, this should be particularly helpful for you.

                    <p>Hey friend, How was your December? Did you set your New Year's resolutions yet? I have some news that might be an early Christmas present, especially if your New Year's resolution is learning to program.</p>
                    <p>Today, I'm launching a brand-new course 🎉. As those of you who have followed me over the years will know, I release a new course every leap year (literally every 4 years or so)! But this one is even more special. &#x2693;<a href="https://auditorium.ai/courses/BdBKnlZyxEvgNFNv10fo23pfrceETQ0A" target="_blank">Learn Javascript in 1 Month</a></p>
                    <p>Not only did it take years to build, but it is based on a completely different way of teaching. Leveraging 2024 technology, I think we've managed to create the <span class="emph">best form of education that currently exists in the world</span>.</p>
                    <p>I checked the stats recently, and I've now taught over 3 million people how to code (I know, that number still baffles me). However, something that has always frustrated me is how limiting the tools are to create my courses. It's 2024 and there are still only two forms of online learning, free videos and paid videos. It's all just video hosting. We've not really moved on since YouTube launched 20 years ago!</p>
                    <p>That's why I've been working with the Auditorium team to build what I think is the future of education. Interactive videos that you can reach into and touch. Code examples that you can run. The code you write gets checked and your programs are verified. Complex code that you can step through and visualise. Everything packaged into one place, where the focus is on doing, instead of installing a million pieces of software.</p>
                    <p>And I've built the course for one of the most requested course topics - Javascript. So if you've ever wanted to do anything with the web, or if you just want to finally succeed at learning your first programming language, you can do it in 31 days.</p>
                    <p>And I know what you're thinking—“But Angela, with AI tools that write code for me, do I even need to learn programming anymore?”</p>
                    <p>The answer is yes, absolutely. AI tools are incredible (I use them too!), but they're like having a GPS. To truly navigate the coding world—whether you're working with low-code or no-code solutions—you need to understand the map. Without knowing the basics of programming, you won't know how to steer those tools in the right direction or troubleshoot when things go wrong.</p>
                    <p>So, why not make 2025 the year you finally check “learn programming” off your resolution list? And if you're still looking for a thoughtful, last-minute gift, my JavaScript course could be just the thing for someone you care about. <span class="key">It's a gift of possibility—a skill that can change lives.</span></p>

                    <p>Years ago, my boss shared valuable advice after I sent him a typically polite British email: “Would it be possible, if it's not too much trouble, when you have time, to review my thesis?” His one-word reply: “No.” I nearly laughed out loud. Later, he explained that every email you send adds to someone's to-do list. Overly polite emails invite more replies, leaving less time for actual work. His advice? Check email sparingly, reply only when necessary, and imagine you're the CEO of a Fortune 500 company—concise and efficient. This month, I found a great list of “email like a boss” tips. For instance, instead of saying “no problem,” you could say “happy to help.” &#x2693;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Ff98jj46mrs7d1.jpeg" target="_blank">reddit</a></p>
