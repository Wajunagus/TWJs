                <span>Reuters Morning Bid U.S.</span><span class="ref1"> | 2:11PM</span>
                    <p>The other buzz of the coming week will be Nvidia's hotly-awaited results on Wednesday -- as the artificial intelligence chip boom sees investors scramble for all things AI-related.</p>
                    <p>Nvidia shares, up about 50% this year, could swing by about 11% in either direction, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. That's the largest expected move options traders have priced in ahead of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years and well above the stock's actual average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS reckoned.</p>
                    <p>With Nvidia's market capitalization at $1.8 trillion, a move of that size would make for a potential swing in market value of about $200 billion. That would be greater than the market capitalization of chipmaker Intel and larger than the respective market values of about 90% of S&P 500 constituents.</p>

                <h2>AI 'tipping point' sends Nvidia, Nasdaq, Nikkei north</h2>
                <span>Reuters Morning Bid U.S.</span><span class="ref1"> | 2:16PM</span>
                    <p>Chip giant Nvidia's uncanny ability to beat even a sky-high bar of earnings expectations and its claim of a "tipping point" in generative artificial intelligence has catapulted stocks in Japan, Europe to record highs and Wall St looks set to follow.</p>
                    <p>Shares in the AI darling soared 12% premarket after it forecast a threefold surge in quarterly revenue that handily beat estimates and sent chip stocks surging around the planet.</p>
                    <p>Nvidia said it expects an eye-popping first-quarter revenue growth of 233%, way ahead of even Wall Street's lofty expectations of 208% growth, and after it raked in some $22 billion of revenue in the quarter just passed. After more than trebling over the past year, the latest stock surge is set to load back another $130 billion in market value onto the $1.7 trillion behemoth and likely reclaim its ranking as America's third most valuable company later on Thursday.</p>
                    <p>"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point," Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang was reported as saying after results were released after the bell on Wednesday and he added the firm can barely keep up with demand.</p>
                    <p>Unsurprisingly, the boom has lifted Nasdaq futures 2% before today's open and after a dour session on Wednesday S&P500 are up over 1% too.</p>
                    <p>But records went off like a Christmas tree around the world through the night as the AI chip frenzy was enough to send Japan's Nikkei leaping to new all-time highs at last - finally surpassing previous peaks set at the height of Japan's property bubble in 1990.</p>
                    <p>Even Europe's STOXX 600 soared almost 1% to hit a new record - beating previous highs set in January 2022 - with its regional chipmakers leading the charge too. Germany's DAX, France's and Amsterdam's all scaled new peaks.</p>
                    <p>The AI buzz around the world and rocketing stock values stand in contrast to the darker mood in interest rate markets - where the Federal Reserve and other central banks appear to be stalling on interest rate cuts in the first half of this year.</p>
                    <p>Despite that, the dollar index fell back to the lowest level in almost three weeks - with the euro leading the way higher after surprisingly upbeat early February business activity readings for the euro zone.</p>

                    <p>A window to the world of custom AI creation, tailor-made for developers.</p>
                    <p>This course presents an opportunity to combine your developer skills with the world of AI to create custom GPTs that interact with 3rd party APIs & services.</p>
                    <p>In addition to learning the basics of creating & publishing custom GPTs, you'll learn how to write OpenAPI specification files, connect your GPTs to APIs that require authentication, & even know how to proxy your GPT actions to your own application for finer control over API requests.</p>
                    <p>OpenAI is working on a true "app" store for GPTs, where creators will get paid based on people using their GPTs, so this is a great time to get started!</p>
