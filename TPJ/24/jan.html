                    <p>You got to stop listening to people when they say it's not possible to do what you want to do, coz they might be a fish trying to climb a tree talking to you being a monkey.</p>
                    <p>When you leave your <strong>comfort zone</strong>, of course you will also face problems.</p>
                    <p>When giving up is not an option, that's when you get the chance to become the strongest version of yourself.</p>
                    <p>When you are suddenly not able to ask someone or Google, you become very creative by simply trying to find your own way, doing your own things coz you have no other option.</p>
                    <p>Being faced with problems is always a chance of making yourself better.</p>
                    <p>I encourage you to take a step back from the hustle & bustle of daily life & ask yourself, what is my <strong>dreamlife</strong>?, what fills me with a <strong>sense of purpose & joy</strong>?. Then <strong>use your passion to guide your actions to fuel your creativity & to cultivate a deep sense of trust in yourself</strong>.</p>
