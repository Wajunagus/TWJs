                Managing risk while day trading | Education
                Steversteves | PREMIUM            
                    Rules for managing risk:
                        1. Support & resistance
                        2. Have a thesis but maintain an open mind
                            Have a thesis & TP
                                - Use your strategy to determine your thesis (i.e. bullish/bearish/flat day).
                                - Your thesis should have a resulting bearish & bullish TP.
                                - Examples of using your strategy include:
                                    - Ascertaining chart patterns & setups
                                    - Ascertaining key support & resistance areas (that have historically been respected for long periods of time)
                                    - Reviewing premarket price action data
                        3. Have a target price in mind before you enter any type of trade on the day.
                        4. Know your stop before you enter your trade at all.
                            Know your stop-out
                                - Before entering you need to ascertain where your stop out should be.
                                - Your stop out should invalidate your thesis.
                                    This means, if you have a bullish thesis, your stop out should invalidate bullishness.
                                    Vice versa if you have a bearish thesis.    
                        5. Scale out along the way
                            - Consider scaling out along the way as an insurance policy.
                            - This locks in profits and hedges your position against it possibly going against you and failing to reach the TP. 
                        6. Trail some of your position
                            It goes without saying, once you hit your TP,
                            take another half and trail the rest to catch the rest of the potential move.
                    Considerations when day trading options
                        => Options are prone to decay from choppy price action! Thus consider:
                            - Scalping smaller moves (so as not to expose yourself to theta decay over time which is exacerbated by choppy PA)
                            - Take profits @ the next resistance level & trail a small portion of your position from there.
                            - Go slightly OTM with your strike and a couple days out of expiry to hedge the volatility.
                    Remember,
                    its not about the P&L,
                    it is about risk management and
                    executing well planned trades!

                <p>I just wanted to inform you that I have just updated the email spoofing lectures (lectures 90, 91) and added a new lecture - lecture 92.</p>
                <p>The reason for this update is the method that was previously covered in these lectures has slightly changed, therefore I made these updates to make sure that you can follow the instructions without any confusion.</p>
                <p>Please let us know in the Q&A if you face any issues or need any assistance and we'll be happy to help.</p>
