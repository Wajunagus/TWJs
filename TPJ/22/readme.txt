        Ikigai The Japanese secret to a long and happy life        	
            Having a strong sense of ikigai - the place where passion, mission, vocation & profession intersect - means
                that each day is infused with meaning.
            It's the reason we get up in the morning.
            It's also the reason many Japanese never really retire
                (in fact there's no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in English):		
            They remain active and work at what they enjoy,
                because they've found a real purpose in life - the happiness of always being busy.
            In researching this book, the authors interviewed the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-olds
                - one of the world's Blue Zones.
            Ikigai reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness:
                how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and community,
                and - their best-kept secret - how they find the ikigai that brings satisfaction to their lives.
                And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own ikigai. Because who doesn't want to find happiness in every day?

                    Intensifying political & economic uncertainity is causing chaos for the British pound which
                    is hitting new lows err' day against major currencies.
        
                    The pound hit its lowest point against the dollar in 37 years on Wed
                    and	opened Thu in its fifth straight session of losses.
                    
                    Sterling has been enduring a barrage of falling prices for most	of 2022 tbh,
                    sinking 4.5% in Aug for its worst month since the Brexit referendum in 2016
                    and	now down over 13% for the year so far.
                    
                    Britain's economic outlook continues to worsen as the ongoing energy crisis plants powerful blows against consumers & businesses -
                    so much so that energy bills in the UK are set to rise 80% in Oct
                    and the looming announcement of a new prime minister is casting additional uncertainity.
                    
                    More losses are looking likely according to analysts,
                    who are forecasting that the UK economy will continue to shrink well into next year.
                    
                    The pound is falling against most other currencies as well,
                    down over 1.85% against the EURO this week for the pairing's worst week since May.

                Downside Breakout
                    Tells me: The price broke downward out of a trading range
                    suggesting we're entering a new downtrend.
                    The Downside Breakout represents a tranding range in which prices
                    move sideways between two parallel horizontal lines.
                    It's often a pause or congestion area within an existing trend
                    though sometimes the breakout results in a reversal to the prior trend.
                    Either way, a downside breakout through the lower support line signals
                    an end to the consolidation period and the start of a downtrend.

            Cognitive dissonance is when contrary evidence shows up and
            threatens a belief that someone strongly holds to simply because they WANT to believe it.
            Then the person fights hard against accepting the evidence (no matter how obvious and convincing it is)
            because it goes against the belief that they want to maintain.
            In other words, their brain simply will NOT reconcile the two!

            Within chaos theory, there exists a term called the butterfly effect,
            which posits that small changes in initial conditions can lead to
            unpredictable and large scale variations in the future of a system.
            Or more simply:
            a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon can cause a tornado in Texas.

        Gig workers are independent contractors,
        online platform workers,
        contract firm workers,
        on-call workers, and temporary workers.
        Gig workers enter into formal agreements with on-demand companies
        to provide services to the company's clients.
                Wikipedia

        A gig economy is a labor market that relies heavily on
        temporary and part-time positions filled by independent
        contractors and freelancers rather than full-time permanent employees.
        Gig workers gain flexibility and independence but little or no job security.

            -------
            Whipsaw describes the movement of stocks in a volatile market when a stock price will suddenly switch direction.
            There is no set rule as to how to manage whipsaw movements in a volatile market as it is an unexpected movement.
            Whipsaw in trading securities often results in trading losses.
            Day traders expect whipsaw movements and often assume long-term,
            buy and hold positions to ride out the fluctuations in price to avoid a loss.

                <h4>This software means you don't have to be a stock market genius to start investing</h4>
                <h5>Tresor FX can help you make informed decisions about investing</h5>
        
                    <p>In the current economic climate, most people are keeping track of their outgoings more than ever.<br>
                    From weekly shopping to monthly spending, knowing precisely what is going in and out of your account is paramount.</p>
        
                    <p>Whilst looking for ways to save money, some are even looking for ways to earn more.<br>
                    If done correctly, one way to earn some extra cash is through investing.</p>
        
                    <p>Using some of the money you have now to invest in things on the stock market,
                    can leave you with financial gains in the long run.</p>
        
                    <p>Although investing may seem daunting if you're not good with numbers or have never thought about doing it before,
                    it doesn't have to be.<br>
                    Tresor FX offers automated trading software that analyses the current market to enable anyone to see when
                    might be the right time to invest.</p>
        
                    <h5>What is Tresor FX software?</h5>
                        <p>Tresor FX is not a financial service, brokerage or investment advisory.
                        The company simply offers software that can be used to analyse the stock market.</p>
        
                        <p>Whether you are a genius with numbers and have an investment portfolio, or are new to the world of investing and
                        are not sure where to start, Tresor FX can help.</p>
        
                        <p>The software can be used for daily tips and
                        analysis of different assets that can help guide you to better analyse the market and
                        make educated decisions on where to invest.</p>
        
                        <p>The software works in a number of ways and uses three different techniques to help you come to a decision on where to invest.
                        Those three techniques are:</p>
        
                        <h5>Technical analysis</h5>            
                            <p>The stock market is full of things called Psychological Levels,
                            which are essentially price levels at rounded, whole-number values.<br>
                            These levels create the appearance of cheap or expensive and can change the way investors react.</p>
        
                            <p>Technical analysis is used to analyse charts and graphs on the stock market and
                            can show you where the psychological levels may break or bounce back.<br>
                            This, in turn, can help you to forecast where the price of a stock may land.</p>            
                        <h5>Fundamental analysis</h5>            
                            <p>Fundamental analysis gives you data about who may be investing and how they are investing in different assets.<br>
                            This gives you a more clear picture of how much attention a certain stock or asset might be getting.</p>
        
                            <p>This clear picture that fundamental analysis can give you,
                            allows you to make a more informed decision about whether to buy or sell your shares.</p>
        
                            <p>Analysts and engineers work around the clock to constantly update the software in order to maintain the performance and
                            keep it up to date with the expectations of investors that are using the automated trading software.<br>
                            Tresor FX will contact its clients if unforeseen circumstances mean the software may change the way it works.</p>
        
                        <h5>Volume analysis</h5>            
                            <p>Volume analysis is the core part of any stock market analysis.<br>
                            The Tresor FX software is connected with global stock exchanges and is a non-stop analysis of the volumes
                            - i.e. how much is going in and out of certain stocks.</p>
        
                            <p>This can help better determine what the value of an asset is and
                            can be a great indication of letting you know other investors' trading decisions.</p>
                    
                    <h5>How does the software work?</h5>

            Criticism is an important part of improvement.
            Understanding what has been done wrongly is key to understanding how to do it correctly.
            The major tech players have certainly had their fair share of criticism recently â€“ from how they handle data,
            to accusations of anti-competitive practices. 
            But this week, an announcement by the Pentagon has reminded us that in an increasingly digitized world,
            society needs tech. Letâ€™s dive in.

                Therapy is one of the most important processes that one should undertake while going through stressful situations.
                Meditation helps a lot to manage thought process especially negative thoughts or compulsive thinking. 
    
                Exercise helps activate feel good bio chemicals keeping depression at bay.
                Working on oneself especially doing shadow work( addressing your weaknesses head on)
                practicing affirmations and gratitude helps to keep one balanced.
                Grounding helps discharge negative ions from the body creating an environment that's not overloaded and
                the risk of misfiring is minimal.
    
                Making sure that one is regularly detoxing and feeding the body with the proper nutrients and minerals is essential.
                This is most important especially when one is on a journey to conceive or pregnant.
                This helps to make sure that both the mother and child reduces the risk of depression,
                right after birth for the mother and later on in life for the child.
                Minerals like iron and iodine are very essential and deficient can lead to depression.
    
                Alcohol and drugs create an extreme false feeling of high which sends the brain pendulum sky high when using and
                all the way low when not using which can lead to depression.
                Chemical reactions caused by alcohol and drugs can throw off the brain chemical balance.
                Staying away from drugs and alcohol is best. 
                Being aware of your diet and detoxing regularly is important to stay healthy and
                away from chronic long term illnesses which can offset depression. 
    
                Nature is one of the most powerful healers of depression,
                do whatever it takes to spend as much time as possible outdoors in nature,
                in water under the sun and in the soil( gardening or just grounding).
                Animals are also very powerful to elevate someone's mood and to keep them engaged and joyful.
                Music(sound) is one of the best healers.
                Practicing sound meditation or just having wind chimes or listening to the birds is very healing.
                The sound of water( ocean, river, springs, rainfall or waterfall) is also very beneficial.
    
                Staying away from synthetic chemicals and using all natural substances and
                products including food storage and food preparation utensils is necessary.
                Use of plastic based products can contribute to unnatural chemistry in the body. 
    
                It's important to find an outlet. Pls talk to someone if you are feeling depressed.
                Be kind to people even though they might not be kind to you.
                Depression is a mental disorder which makes one to feel trapped and
                might not be able to respond in a civil and loving manner.
                It's a mental slavery that feels hopeless.

                1. You have a substance abuse problem because of neuroplasticity in your basal forebrain.
                    It has nothing to do with moral, ethical or character flaws.
                    the opposite is also true,
                    only way to fix this is to reverse said neuroplastic change through abstinence and redirection.
                2. Transforming your life by fighting poor habits/terrible addictions is not about will power.
                    Will power is fleeting & short-lived.
                    Not sustainable.
                    To truly quit any & all addictions - you need to understand the mechanism of addiction and 
                    have systems to fight it.
                3. You fail to break an addiction because deep down you don't want it bad enough.
                    You Know this.
                    You pretend to make a half-assed effort for consolation.
                    The reality is, you are afraid.
                    You fear change, you fear effort, you fear looking failure in the eye again.

                Elon Musk sells Tesla shares worth $3.95 billion days after Twitter deal                        
                By Akriti Sharma and Hyunjoo Jin
            
                    (Reuters) -Tesla Inc top boss Elon Musk has sold $3.95 billion worth of shares in the electric-vehicle maker,
                    regulatory filings showed, days after he closed the $44-billion deal for Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR).
            
                    The latest sale brings total Tesla stocks sold by Musk to about $36 billion since November last year,
                    leaving him with a roughly 14% stake in the world's most valuable automaker, according to a Reuters calculation.
            
                    Musk unloaded 19.5 million shares between Friday and Tuesday,
                    filings published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed on late Tuesday.
            
                    Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the purpose of the share sale.
            
                    Analysts had widely expected Musk to sell more Tesla shares to finance the Twitter deal
                    even though the world's richest man had asserted several times that he was done selling Tesla stock.
            
                    He sold $6.9 billion worth of Tesla shares in August and
                    had amassed about $20 billion in cash through multiple stake sales from November last year to August.
            
                    This would have left him in need to raise an additional $2 billion to $3 billion to finance the Twitter deal,
                    according to a Reuters calculation.
            
                    The billionaire last month closed the deal with $13 billion in loans from banks and a $33.5 billion equity commitment,
                    which included his 9.6% Twitter stake worth $4 billion and
                    $7.1 billion from investors including Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.
            
                    Shares of Tesla were up by 0.7% to $192.64 in premarket trading.
                    The company has lost nearly half its market value ever since Musk bid for Twitter in April.

                    They are used as the basis for most technical analysis.
